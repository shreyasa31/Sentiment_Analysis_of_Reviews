       " '  jaws  is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen  \\nthe movie opens with blackness  and only distant  alienlike underwater sounds  \\nthen it comes  the first ominous bars of composer john williams now infamous score  \\ndahdum  \\nfrom there  director steven spielberg wastes no time  taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly  \\nright away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean  and once  jaws  has attacked  it never relinquishes its grip  \\nperhaps what is most outstanding about  jaws  is how spielberg builds the movie  \\nhe works it like a theatrical production  with a first act and a second act  \\nunlike so many modern filmmakers  he has a great deal of restraint  and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act  \\nuntil then  he merely suggests its presence with creepy  subjective underwater shots and williams music  \\nhes building the tension bit by bit  so when it comes time for the climax  the sharks arrival is truly terrifying  \\nhe doesnt let us get bored with the imagery  \\nthe first act opens with police chief martin brody  roy scheider   a new york cop who has taken an easy  peaceful job running the police station on amity island  a fictitious new england resort town where there hasnt been a murder or a gun fired in  years  \\nthe island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july  and the mayor  larry vaughn  murray hamilton   doesnt want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money  \\nbrody is joined by matt hooper  richard dreyfuss   a young  ambitious shark expert from the marine institute  \\nhooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it  his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark   its a perfect engine  an eating machine   make it that much more terrifying  \\nwhen vaughn finally relents  hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint  robert shaw  on his decrepit boat  the orca  to search for the shark  \\nthe entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark  and inevitably  are hunted by it  \\n  jaws  is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing  tension  and horror  \\nit is like ten movies all rolled into one  and its no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of   taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time  until it was unceremoniously dethroned in  by  star wars    \\neven today  fascination with this film is on par with hitchcocks  psycho   and it never seems to age  \\nalthough grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences  including several mechanical sharks  obsolete  none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill  \\nthe technical limitations faced by spielberg in  may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing  characterization  sharp editing  and creative photography  instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects  \\nscheider  dreyfuss  and shaw were known actors at the time  jaws  was made  but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman  \\nnevertheless  this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark  \\nscheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing whats right and going against the entire town  \\n  its your first summer here  you know   mayor vaughn warns him  \\ndreyfuss  who had previously been seen in  american graffiti     and  the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz     gives a surprisingly mature  complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers  \\nhowever  most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movies captain ahab  a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards  \\nbordering of parody  shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism  \\nhes slightly deranged  and shaws performance is almost a caricature  \\nhowever  there is one scene late in the film  when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars  \\nquint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u  s  s  \\nindianapolis  a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese  \\nhis tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over    other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hairraising than anything spielberg put on screen  \\nshaw delivers the story in one long take  and it is the best acting in the film  \\nof course  we cant leave out the shark itself  with its black eyes  endless rows of teeth  and insatiable urge to eat  it is basically the epitome of all mankinds fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature  \\na shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real  having survived sinch the dinosaurs  great whites do exist  they can be as large as the shark in  jaws   and they are a threat  \\nevery one of spielbergs subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark  a bunch of writihing  dangling  completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into  \\nthe shark in  jaws  was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks  all nicknamed  bruce  by the crew  built to be shot from different angles  \\nmany have forgotten  but  jaws  was a sort of precursor to  waterworld      a movies who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb  \\nbut  as we can see now  spielberg overcame all the obstacles  and delivered one of the finest primal scarethrillers ever to come out of hollywood  \\n',\n",

independence movements that gripped africa in the s and s  \\n  during the time the story takes place  many new nations  including nigeria and somalia  were born  with varying degrees of success and failure  usually dependent upon which country colonized them  \\nsome colonial masters were better than others   \\nthe effort involved in  lumumba  is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades  if at all  \\nproduction values are first rate on what must be a small  by us standards  budget  \\nthe period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique  \\nthe screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeomans work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumbas life  \\nthe political side of things is evenly told in a linear  straightforward manner that teaches  not preaches  \\nit concentrates on the good deeds of the man  if a bit as a stalwart saint  but doesnt embellish on a larger than life persona  \\nthe family side of patrices life is handled in several  perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children  embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child  \\ni know the intent is to flesh the man out  but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba  \\nthe story  as such  has a lopsided feel about it  \\nhigh marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character  \\nthe actor gives a convincing  charismatic performance as the multifaceted  politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions  \\nin true docudrama tradition  the supporting cast does not outshine the star  complementing his good efforts  instead  \\n  lumumba  is a solid  interesting  educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos  both  \\nit has more intelligence in its telling than anything ive seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b  \\n',\n",

ancient tradition and virtues like honour  loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler  kinder ages  \\nmartin scorsese  another italoamerican moviemaker  confronted that perspective with his own  more downtoearth vision of mafia in  mean streets  movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime  \\nunfortunately for scorsese  his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppolas influence on mafia portrayals in the movies  \\nseventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime  \\nthis film was goodfellas  epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of s  \\ngoodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story  told in bestseller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi  who would cowrite the screenplay for the film   \\nthe book  as well as the film  chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill  played by ray liotta   irishitalian criminal from new york  \\nat the age of  he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero  played by paul sorvino   local mob boss  and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands  \\nafter couple of years  together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito  played by joe pesci   he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway  played by robert de niro   \\nthree of them spend years as best friends and associates  gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history  \\nwealth  influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen  played by lorraine bracco   who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities  domestic abuse  arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business  \\nbut the perfect world of  wiseguys  gradually begins to fall apart  tommys unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence  jimmys reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and  finally  henrys own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends  \\ngoodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory  \\nscorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker  \\nworld depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating  \\nscorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence  hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime  yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny  \\nafter being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history  based on some notorious real life events   the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths  trading the superficial and shortlasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens  \\nscorsese also manages to break viewers moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material  scenes that depict personal tragedies  broken homes  human depravity  violence  bloodshed and murder  in all their uncompromising reality  but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience  \\nwith the use of ironic soundtrack  manipulative shots  characters dialogue or narrators commentary  goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era  \\neven if we dont pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining  we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker  \\nfirst  we might notice unusual structure of the plot  relatively minor subplot is used as movies ironic prologue  \\nthen  instead of single narrator  scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards  \\nthis multiple points of views  both in terms of narration and various subjective shots  only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation  \\nsame ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack  \\nnostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easylistening s pop songs  while depression  paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late s and s  \\nbut the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment  almost pastoral  easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed  \\nhowever  thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people  \\nsuch scenes  although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings  became very popular among other directors in s  \\nfragmentary character of the screenplay  which doesnt have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes  gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese  \\nhe uses this structure of film to experiment  and most successful of such experiments is hilarious  a day in life  segment near the end of the film  \\nanother essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents  \\nthe most respectable among them is robert de niro  but his character  who happen to be most quiet and businesslike member of criminal trio  gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues  \\njoe pesci deserved his  oscar  for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy  and his lines  including adlibs  probably represent the most memorable element of the film  \\nray liotta  although equally talented  perhaps doesnt look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film  \\nliottas henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of lowlevel street thugs  \\nliotta  on the other hand  improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction  \\nlorraine bracco is  on the other hand  very effective and believable as karen hill  wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband  \\npaul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso  and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering smalltime gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave  \\nas a combination of clever sociological study  black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do  work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time  \\nbecause of this achievement  and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers  this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of s  \\n',\n",

approach  because instead of trying to cover similar ground  it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand  \\nbut soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story  that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue  \\nin a way  this is a typical hollywood sequel  \\nmore money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail  \\nthe horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated  \\nof course in these situations  quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values  \\nfrom its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloodyred forest  with carter burwells   being john malkovich  and  fargo   musical score in the background  you realize that with the exception of its title  this film has absolutely nothing to do with  the blair witch project   \\n  blair witch    \\nwas filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation  \\nin the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection  creating a completely different atmosphere  \\nwith its graceful cinematography  production design and flashy editing  the film has a very polished look  which is impossible to associate with the first installment  \\nand though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times  he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor  \\nthe key is simplicity  \\n  blair witch project  had a story which was incredibly simple  \\nthat allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination  \\nthe film was practically an empty screen  on which we projected our most frightening nightmares  \\nthe effect was incredibly powerful  lasting and entir e everyone  but in a different way  \\n  book of shadows  feels incredibly controlled and restrict  \\nhere  very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and  clever  that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it  \\nthere is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with  \\nthis is simply a less artistic film that doesnt have the talent and originality of its predecessor  \\nit resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesnt always succeed  \\nbut most importantly  it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie  which doesnt allow it to destroy the original  \\nin the end  i cant call it a bad effort  \\nits less artistic  not so scary and less original  but certainly not bad  \\nits simply different  \\nin fact  if you havent seen  the blair witch project   you might like this film for what it is  a cross between  the blair witch project  and the  scream  films  \\nthe only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting  jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned  and incredible sense of surrealism  \\nbut its a common knowledge and experience that  with a few exceptions  every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making  \\nto me the story of  the blair witch project  seemed completed  but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that  the book of shadows  is certainly assured  \\nand its

not have thought much of otherwise  \\nwith some films it might be just a secondary issue  but with dark city what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are  which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifullyconstructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie  \\ntheres an old roleplaying computer game called d  ja v   wherein the player takes on the role of a man who cant remember who he is  where he is and how he got there  \\nthe goal is to gather as

begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city  actually  its more than just the city  its the whole reality  that isnt just that neogothic look  a la batman   blade runner     but is so fully developed its almost a different genre completely  \\nlater he will learn that his name is john murdoch  sewell   but for now he has no idea whats going on other than the fact something is not right  \\nthe fact theres a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious  hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling  \\nthis opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre  horrific tone  \\nthe man doesnt know who he is nor where hes going and its interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him  \\nin fact  this is the way all stories begin since its impossible to know the history of a character  their feelings  values  morals  etc  until after weve observed them for a while  \\nbut in this case  the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization  developing the mood and outlining the story  \\neventually  some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police  \\nwe met inspector frank bumstead  hurt   a quiet  unemotional  softspoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time  \\ntwo other important characters are also introduced  dr  daniel p  schreber  sutherland   a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be johns doctor  and emma murdoch  connelly   a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old filmnoir movies  \\nit was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film  \\nhe also contacts emma  which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex  mysterious back story  \\nbut absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in dark city   which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo  \\neverything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance  considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot  its lighting  art direction and overall production design  they dont seem to be able to afford any gratuities  \\nhowever  that might also be whats keeping it from reaching its maximum potential  \\nby continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place  so much unlike the real world we know  we come to realize that its all a hoax  \\neveryone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction  \\nbut  as the films tagline says  last night  one of us went off   \\nfor reasons that are never clearly explained  it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive  a process known as tuning   \\nthe aliens  which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin  also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight  \\nat the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made  they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then  \\nthis premise certainly is interesting and director and coscreenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard  \\nhe does provide some explanations such as that dr  schreber is an assistant to the strangers because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form  \\nthe aliens mix and match the memories of the citys population to see who will change and who will not  \\nin the process this creates for a good deal of deep  thoughtprovoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world  \\nhowever  where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is  \\nthe main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened  yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant  static and cold  mediocre performances by hurt and connelly dont help either   \\nfor example  john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her  yet in some scenes crucial to the films plot  we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other  which is also part of the films climax and ending  \\nand thats what proyas seems to be inferring with the film  but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense  \\nironically  this is what made his first film the crow work so well  which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical  dark twisted world  \\nwith dark city the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message  \\nstill  the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable  \\ntheres a lot to like here  most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does  \\nthe story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years  \\ndark city is what the movies are all about  the escape from the real

who doesnt look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy  \\neven  planets  make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film  tatooine  the desert world where luke grew up   coruscant  the cloud city from  empire strikes back    and alderaan  leias home planet  which we never actually see  that gets blown up in  star wars   show up or are mentioned briefly in passing  \\nwhats the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films  \\nthe answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty  \\ntheres no meat  no substance  that makes you want to love the characters as they are  not as they will be  \\nanother problem is that there are actually  too many  alien characters in the film  \\ni was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters  strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters  had mouths that barely moved  making them look more like muppets than actual characters  \\nand jar jar binks  a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character  is intended as comic relief  but what he really becomes is annoying  and fast  \\nunlike chewbacca and cpo  who got their humanity  if youll pardon the expression  from their interactions with the human characters  jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind  at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive  teenage mutant ninja turtles   \\nfurthermore  the dialogue is often stilted and corny  and sometimes downright infantile  thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot  \\noddly  this isnt just  my  judgment  lucas has said that he designed this film for kids  \\nwell  hes done a good job  \\nthe hero of this film  of course  is young anakin  but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eightyearold boy  \\nthats not jake lloyds fault  though  he does a good job of being a cute kid  which is apparently all lucas asked of him  \\nthats another mistake  of course  because the cute tyke becomes darth vader  \\nwarning  spoilers ahead     \\nin my opinion  there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakins future evil in the film  \\nthe boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks  and theres nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie  \\nhe has a doting mother  pernilla august  making her first english language film  and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine  \\nbut the only indication the audience gets that this kid isnt all hearts and roses is yodas hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under quigon jinn  \\nhis explanation  \\n  his future is clouded   \\n  warning  major spoiler ahead  \\nenter at your own risk   \\nof course  the noble quigon dies at the hand of darth maul  a scarylooking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts  but has turned to the dark side  \\nthis dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie  but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his doublesided lightsaber  and his scary facial makeup  \\nbecause quigon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force  obiwan  quigons young padawan apprentice  one level below knightdom   must take over the training himself  \\nso  at the end of the movie  we end where the saga actually begins  with obiwan kenobi and his young apprentice  anakin  darth vader  skywalker  \\ndid this story need to be told  \\ni would say no  \\nbut is it a worthwhile movie to see  \\nabsolutely  \\nif you dont enter the theater with jedisize expectations  and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle  then this is your movie  \\nthe tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation  \\nthe digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight  \\nand yoda and young obiwan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler  happier time  \\nabove all  this is a fun movie  \\nnot deep  not meaningful  and not profound  \\nbut fun  \\nmaybe next time  lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to cowrite the script  and the guy who directed  empire  will direct  \\nbecause if lucas does the next one himself  it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most  potential  \\n   \\n',\n",

saying  see you soon    \\nof course  its meant to be a parody  but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety  \\nyou begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat  not something you like  not something you enjoy  but rather something you experience  \\nexperiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses  fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts  \\ntrust me  you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point  \\njuzo itamis tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western  set in modern day japan  \\na stranger

goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest  and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert  enlist the aid of a wealthy patron  and make friends with the former enemy  \\nthis film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems  \\ntake  for example  when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner  \\nthe price is too high  but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum  \\ntampopo meets him at his store late at night  and he leads her to a back room  \\nshe protests  thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives  but he insists  \\njust when she is about to bolt for the exit  he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door  \\nshe peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day  her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience  \\nthis scene  while comical  is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation  then of relief and discovery  \\ntheres also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who  despite their economic trappings  are all gourmets and master sommeliers  \\nwe even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet  \\nthe scene is meant to bring a laugh  but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor  food is something which everyone has in common  and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all  \\nthere are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film  which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in peoples lives  \\na particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor  \\nsurrounded by her children  she is obviously in her last hours of life  \\nher husband comes home  and seeing her worsened condition  demands that she get up and make dinner  \\nthe viewer knows the husbands intention is not to be mean  he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived  and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this  \\nin a near miracle  the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal  then brings it to her awaiting family  \\nas the family eats  she looks on them and smiles  \\npreparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her  and for a brief moment  she too enjoys the normalcy  \\nthen she falls over  dead  \\nfor a moment  the family is stunned  but then the father yells at the children   keep eating  \\nthis is the last meal your mother ever made   \\ncrying as they do so  the family finishes the meal  \\nthe scene is comical  awkward  moving  and beautiful  \\nby including the vignettes  itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film  but surprisingly  they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline  \\ninstead  they even help contribute to the idea that tampopos goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble  \\nbecause the film parodies a western  the construction of the plot is fairly predictable  but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the  good guys  come together for the final showdown  \\nin this case  the showdown is against the ramen  \\nif they eat tampopos ramen  soup and all  tampopo knows she has succeeded  \\nits pretty obvious what the outcome will be  but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of

to go against his programming and become what he wants to be  a hero  \\nthe final sequence is touching and appropriate  though i wont give it away  i will say that very few will be disappointed

characters are all handdrawn the oldfashioned way  \\nthe characters faces are done quite well  drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible  but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief  \\nfine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth  and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress

have drawn up paperthin stereotypes and figure the kids wont mind  but  the iron giant  has clearly put a little work into making the characters real  and it pays off  \\nthe film isnt only around to deliver heavyhanded messages  though  \\nits also very funny  and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy  \\nthe scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things  such as dive into a pool  are handled well  and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing  having worked on  the simpsons  for many years  \\na sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to  outlast  one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed  and also extremely clever  \\nthe film even takes some jabs at americas nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war  satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to  duck and cover  in the event of a nuclear attack  \\n  the iron giant  has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films  and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing  \\ninstead of seeing people get bonked on the head  we get welltimed  clever gags that seem to have required some

       " 'mpaa  not rated  though i feel it would likely be pg  for martialarts violence   \\nwith three movies already  re  released theatrically in america  and at least three more on their way  jackie chan is one of the newest  hot properties  in action adventure stardom  and its just about time  \\nfor over twentyfive years  jackies been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong  thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy  \\n  drunken master  has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to  make it big  this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong  \\nim not entirely sure why  exactly  \\nin many ways   drunken master  is similar to most of jackies other early films  such as  fearless hyena  i and ii   master with cracked fingers    half a loaf of kung fu    spiritual kung fu   and others  \\nin fact  looking at all these early films together  one gets the impression that they were stamped out  cookiecutter style  at a rate of four to six per year  all using the same casts and telling very similar stories  \\nto be honest  i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste  \\ntheyre quite different from action movies as we know them in america  \\nthese films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past  with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together  \\n  drunken master   though its plot is tighter than some  is no exception  \\n  as an aside   drunken master  was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw  and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen    in \\na movie theater in seattle  as part of an asian film festival  \\nat the time  i didnt really think it was anything special    but \\nafter having seen more films like it  its kind of grown on me   \\n  drunken master  s storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies  such as  fearless hyena  i and ii and  master with cracked fingers  slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harshseeming master  and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end  a formula that has been  adapted   to put it kindly  by american films such as karate kid   \\nmore specifically  jackie chan plays the part of wong feihong  aka  naughty panther   a funloving  practicaljoking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good  but not _quite_ good enough  \\nafter embarrassing his instructors assistant by beating him roundly  then beating up a bully in a marketplace  wong feihong tries to hit on a pretty girl  but discovers that she  and her mother  can hit back  better than he can    and \\nis further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt  respectively  \\nhis father  wong keiying  is unhappy about this  and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages  \\nkeiying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment  which feihong does not like at all  \\nwhile escaping from this punishment  feihong meets up with a drunken old man  who proceeds to thrash him soundly  then take him on as a student and thrash him some more  \\nthis turns out to be su huachi  a legendary master of drunkenstyle kung fu  \\nhe assigns feihong a series of bizarre tasks  such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame  cracking walnuts with his hands  and other such exercises  that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up  \\nthen  when hes ready  he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu  \\nunfortunately  the lazy feihong only practices six of them    \\n  drunken master  features some wonderful martial arts sequences  with jackie winning some fights and losing others  \\nits been said before  but ill say it againthese fights dont just _happen_  theyre as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance  and it shows  \\nin his fights  jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment benches  jugs  cups  bowls  fruits and vegetablesoften in new and surprising ways  \\nthe fight scenes  particularly those toward the end of the film  are unparallelled in most american films  \\nwhether jackie wins or loses  its really something to see    and \\nits often as funny as anything  too  \\nand funny is the other thing jackie chan is very  very good at  \\ntheres very little thats new in this moviejackie winning fights  jackie getting beaten badly by a master  jackie going through punishment or training    these \\nschticks have all been seen before  in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties  \\nbut theyre still hilarious as ever  \\nlikewise  jackie has a _great_ supporting cast  many of whom were also in other early jackie films  and theyre often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own  \\nthe really big thing about  drunken master   though  that inspired several copycats  including a couple starring jackie himself  and a sequel fifteen years later  was the drunkenstyle kung fu  \\nim not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu  but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security    and \\nit apparently helps if youre drunk while youre doing it  \\ngenuine or not  i have to admit  theres just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize whats going on  \\ncome to think of it  perhaps this element is what accounts for this films success over any of the other jackie films    its \\nnot just martial arts  its the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go   whoa     \\non the negative side  the cinematography in this film is nothing special  the film stock is rather primitive  the plot is often rather slow  and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background  \\n  gone with the wind   this isnt  \\nstill  if you like martial arts films  or like what youve seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more  give it a shot  \\nits much more  real  than chuck norris or jeanclaude van damme  \\nyou might very well like it  \\nanother interesting thing about  drunken master  has to do with its video availability in the us  \\n  drunken master  is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original  letterboxed  hong kong subtitled form  commercially available on vhs  from magnum video  in a gold box  for about    \\nthere are plenty of other early jackie films around  but these are typically either in dubbed  panandscanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase  \\nthankfully   drunken master   at least  is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen  at a very affordable price  \\nif you like  drunken master   take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there  even the dubbed ones arent really _too_ bad    if \\nnothing else  you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue   \\ni particularly recommend  spiritual kung fu    half a loaf of kung fu   the  fearless hyena  movies  and  snake  crane arts of shaolin   \\nalso  the mostlyunrelatedstorywise sequel   drunken master ii   will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year  though what its americanrelease title will be is still uncertain  and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer  \\nalso  for a rather different interpretation of the character wong feihong  who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore   ive been told to suggest the  once upon a time in china  series starring jet li  though i havent personally seen any of them yet   \\nif you choose to watch  drunken master   i really hope you enjoy it  and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema thats out there  \\nall in all  i give this film an  \\n',\n",

       " 'logical time travel movies are a nearimpossibility  \\nconsidering that the skeptics best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities  writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task  \\noccasionally  we get a film that does manage it  \\nterry gilliams   monkeys  was one such film  \\nbut more frequently  we get films that dont much deal with it at all  \\nthere is one question to ask in this case  does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies  \\nthe  terminator  films made up for them

police detective  \\na strange occurrence  the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city  allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in  and that john has found in the present day  \\nthough both are initially skeptical of the idea  john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire  and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom  \\nnow flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive  john is initially overjoyed  until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous  a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women  \\nfrank and john now must work together to set things right  with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past  \\nthe premise of  frequency  is unusual  and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept  john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions  \\nthis isnt explained  you just have to go with it  \\nwhen frank doesnt die in a fire  john is the only one who remembers it differently  while everyone else remembers it the new way  \\nthe concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities   and   are to each other  \\nsometimes franks changing the past results in something happening right away in johns world  and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time  \\nnow  the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this  and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted  but nevertheless logical  if i thought about it hard enough  for example  the reason john gets advance information of the serial killers murders was because the change had already happened in franks world  and john is only witnessing the  projection  of that change   but explanations arent really the point  \\nwhen  frequency  gets cooking  its a riveting little thriller  even if it is confusing  \\nwhat matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment  and  frequency  works as long as it keeps moving  \\nthe film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion  \\ndirector gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure  frequency  as good hollywood entertainment  establishing decent  likable characters  making us care for them  and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved  \\ni liked many of the creative touches  the split screens  allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities  and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward  \\nit actually uses the  metsorioles world series  the one that featured the amazin mets  to great effect  frank uses johns advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him  \\n  admittedly  this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself   \\ni even liked the final scene  which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods  \\nsome may find this scene blindingly confusing  as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious  but it does make sense if you think about it  and give the script a lot of leeway   and lets face it  its a darn cool way to end the film  \\nthere are enough surprises and plot twists in  frequency  to keep you on your toes  and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant  \\nthe other major thing to appreciate about  frequency  is the handling of the fatherson relationship  \\nquaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily  its a rocksolid job from both actors  \\nthe relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept  how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative  or with a future descendant  \\nwatching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question  \\nthe credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film  if we dont believe in the characters  we dont care about the outcome of the thriller plot  \\nhere  we do care  because we like the lead actors  \\ni also liked some of the supporting cast members  \\nelizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles  playing julia the doting wife  and  mother  but still performs admirably  \\nandre braugher  late of the television show  homicide  life on the street   gives a nice supporting turn as franks best friend and future colleague of john  \\nhe has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while franks world series predictions come true before his very eyes  \\nbraugher strikes the perfect facial expression here  simultaneously dismayed and amused  \\nperhaps the only thing i didnt like about  frequency  is the overly sentimental coda  during which the cameras focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard  \\nbut thats only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics  \\ni freely acknowledge that  frequency  may best work as a  guy  movie  since it focuses on the very maleoriented idea of fatherson relationships  echoes of  field of dreams  can be easily heard   but the underlying concept is universally applicable  \\nwho wouldnt want to speak with a longdead parent  \\nor see how their children turn out  \\n  tell me about your life  son   excuse me while i mist up  \\nand dont call me a

\\nthere is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional  however  the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passiondenying protagonist  stephane  daniel auteuil   \\nstephane  daniel auteuil  is a master violin maker  \\nhe is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing  \\neven the relationship between he and his boss  maxime  andre dussollier  is a controlled  and almost manipulated association  highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches  \\nin the beginning of the movie  stephane is a closed  solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man  \\ncamille kessler  emmanuelle beart  is a master violinist and the new love of maximes  \\nmaxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife  \\nlike stephane  camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved  sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges  \\nwhen stephane and camille meet  there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals  \\nhowever  whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane  stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him  \\nstephane ignores his feelings for camille  which the audience cannot help but to see is present  \\nas the movie progresses  the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another  \\nthese two people  with very similar approaches to life initially  react to their new circumstance very differently  \\nstephane becomes even more rational and controlled  while camille becomes more tempestuous  until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship  \\nhowever  their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation  \\nthe audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well  due to his relationship with a master violin teacher  \\nhowever  apparently  he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing  \\nconsequently  stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays  \\nin contrast  camille had almost given the violin  years earlier  \\nhowever  with the aid of her manager  she has progressed to being almost one of the worlds finest  successfully submerging herself to her playing  \\nduring the course of the movie  we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions  \\nstephane attempts to remain unchanged  \\nhowever  we do see subtle hints of his transformation  \\none of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash  \\nthe development of all of the characters  many of which is not included in this synopsis  is incredible  \\namerican movies  with rare exceptions  have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development  \\nin its essence  this movie is about the development and growth of the characters  camille and stephane  \\nthe portrayal of all the other characters in the movie  including a death  is to further the development of camilles and stepahnes characters  \\ni am not sure why berardinelli says   at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified  and it is to auteuils credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty   \\nthis movie is not about judging stephanes actions as being right or wrong  but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are  \\ni find the ending appropriate  unfortunately  i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling  \\nthis portion of the film is where the  sense of closure  could have been successfully accomplished  \\nunfortunately  there is a hurried and almost a soap operatype surge of emotions from all of the characters  \\nwhile ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart  ravel has his day in this film  \\nthe synergism of the tension of ravels music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen  \\nthe directing in this movie is wonderful  \\nthe actors and actresses are excellent  each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth  \\nemmanuelle bearts personality is beautiful  \\nand needless to say  i must say that emmanuelle beart  herself  is beautiful  \\nbesides the near ending  the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral  \\ni almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of  \\nthe one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot  has their attitude towards love changed  \\ni have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at  but i am unsure of which the director is espousing  \\nin summary  this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship  \\nin the process  we see their attitude towards life and other people  \\nin itself  i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie  \\nwhere it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we  as americans  have preconceived american notions of relationship  love  and people  \\ni do

effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks  \\nthe film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual  \\nof the several dozen actors to play azazel  the best is by far elias koteas  exotica  crash   who  despite only being on screen for about ten minutes  gives a fantastically charged performance  \\njohn goodman also seems to be enjoying himself  although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick  \\nsadly  however  these two are the only ones who excel  \\neveryone else  including denzel washington  is boring  \\nwashingtons flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film  \\nits not that hes bad per se  but hes not very interesting  \\ntheres no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character  and that keeps us distanced  however slightly  from hobbes  \\nas circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop  and as his lifeordeath chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate  i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was  \\nwashingtons subdued approach is part of the reason for this  i never felt a sense of urgency  \\nhowever  at least washington was believable  which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz  schindlers list  and donald sutherland  \\nto be fair  the flaws in their characters arent all actingrelated  neither stanton nor gretta milano are wellwritten  \\nthat said  however  theres nothing inspired about either davidtzs or sutherlands work  \\nboth appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts  as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multidimensional individual  \\nnarratively  fallen has a few glaring weaknesses  \\nalthough the plot proceeds with a convoluted  gamelike structure  it uses a denzel washingtonsupplied voiceover to overexplain matters  \\nat times  this is actually helpful  and it has a use beyond the obvious  but there are occasions when ponderous lines like  i like the night  sometimes you come face to face with yourself  become a little hard to swallow  \\nin addition  fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland  generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel  \\nhowever  despite the negatives  im still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending  which i loved  \\nthe final scenes are startling  audacious  and unexpected  \\nits not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did  \\nat a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes  fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself  \\nthis is not a great motion picture  but  considering how bad most january releases are  its a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours  \\nand  whatever you do  dont walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll  \\n',\n",

away with  \\nin emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles  but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his  giallo  murder mysteries  \\nwhile its certainly not perfect  repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller  \\nthe story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal  anthony franciosa  where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book  tenebrae   \\nwith the police on his back for leads  he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems  \\nthe film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa  \\nhe brings grace  charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding reallife horror around him  \\nthe film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension  \\nargento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral  ambivalent  shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business  \\ntenebrae is perhaps the most multilayered of argentos scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here  \\nit may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play  \\nin that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep redprofondo rosso  the fulllength italian language version  and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes  \\nneedless to say for argento fans  there is no denying the directors brilliance as a stylist  \\nmany of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork  \\nthey are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light  rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria  \\ninstead  tenebraes set design and lighting paints a sleek  clinical  chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world  \\nand the soundtracks mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment  \\nso tenebrae has much to recommend it  no question  \\nstill  constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative  \\nsome critics argue that logic doesnt matter in argento films  but damnit  it matters in all films to the point where viewers dont deserve to feel cheated  \\nby the way  if you dont want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs  \\nabout an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which  properly handled  could have proved ingenious  \\nwe witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who  we later discover  is none other than the author peter neal  \\nhe is insane  apparently  \\nthe murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides its time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife  \\nhe is finally revealed to us as this  second killer  in the films bloody climax  \\nbut argento muffs the twist  both technically and narratively  \\nyou see  we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killers house  \\nbut thanks to poor editing  its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway  \\nbad cutting puts the timing way out  \\nin other words  hes almost in two places at once  \\nduring this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring  \\nby the films end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have selfinflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant  \\nthe injury  \\nhe banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock  \\nthus  the revelation of the  hero  as a killer  and antihero  in the final scenes may still prove shocking  but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled  \\nhelpfully  in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along  \\nbut there too is a problem  as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least  \\nthe story owes us a better understanding of franciosas mind  his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage  \\ntenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies  \\nfor instance  a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike  \\nwe would assume the rider is the same boy  but it turns out to be some male character we arent even introduced too  \\nthats careless filmmaking  pure and simple  \\nwhy  you may ask  do i go on about the storys flaws  \\nbecause when it comes to visuals and set pieces  argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world  \\ntake one of the extended scenes in tenebrae  \\nan upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where  almost unbelievably  it jumps a high fence and chases her across town  \\nfinally  as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine  she accidentally stumbles on the serial killers lair  \\nits an absolutely masterful sequence  tense and exciting  and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone  \\nand thats exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating  \\ntoo often  it seems  argentos films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts  \\nmind you  if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look  \\nand if youre a fan of argentos unique style of giallo thriller then its essential  \\nsee the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli  \\nits a stylish  greatlooking and quirky film despite the problem narrative  \\na shame  because it doesnt have to be that way  \\ntake argentos more recent stendhal syndrome     where with the aid of cowriter franco ferrini he fashioned a

less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it  \\nquite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through  and it didnt do that  \\nthey also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and alltootrue attack on the way the american political media works  and it didnt quite do that either  \\na few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubricks  dr  \\nstrangelove  in the tradition of political black comedy  and it most definitely didnt do that  \\nthat said   wag the dog  is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them  \\nthe story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean  robert deniro  to distract the american public from the accusations that the president  who is up for reelection in two weeks  sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office  \\nthe accusations  the script suggests  are probably untrue  but as brean so pointedly puts it  that isnt particularly relevant  the scandal is likely to derail the presidents campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood  \\nbrean  along with his assistant  anne heche   decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss  dustin hoffman  to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and specialeffects trickery to make it appear that the u  s  is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor  \\nas i said   wag the dog  is not quite as laughoutloud hilarious as i had expected  but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here  such as when  in an echo of a familiar movie clich   the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting  inspirational music  then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform  we have the right to fight for democracy   \\nanother scene shows us how  with modern editing equipment  an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village  \\nthe most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda teams attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt  \\nwilliam  old shoe  schumann  woody harrelson   an exmilitary officer who turns out to be a firstclass psycho  \\nof course  not everything goes as planned  the cia  for example  realizes whats going on and strikes a deal with the presidents electoral opponent to report to the media that the  fighting  has ended  forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis  \\nstill  even with the cias involvement  the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable  \\nregardless of the official word from the president or the cia  wouldnt the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is  in fact  no fighting going on in albania  \\nthe film never addresses this question  nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical  such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt  \\nschumann  we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it  \\nthere was also an instance  towards the end of the film  in which one of motsss forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away  \\nwith these plot holes   wag the dog  doesnt quite work as a satire of american politics  but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place  \\nbrean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical  rather  they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off  \\nthe film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end  as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret  \\nmotss and his hollywood buddies  meanwhile  seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project  \\nin fact  one of the sources of conflict in the film is motsss increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war  in his mind  it is the greatest work of art he has ever created  \\ni think its fair to say that  wag the dog  underachieves a little bit  more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a fourstar film and a classic satire  \\nstill  the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one  \\nwag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks  what if the war wasnt even real  \\nwith this premise and the talented cast  the film still delivers more consistently than most  whatever its flaws  \\n',\n",

into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house  \\nthe classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomons mines had underwritten characters also  \\njurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs  \\nthe characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be  and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting  \\nsome of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds  \\nthat degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require  \\ni feel i got my moneys worth  \\nthe story opens with eric  played by trevor morgan  and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica

has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs  \\nbut again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go  \\ndoing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric

has alan grant and ellie sattler  laura dern  back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm  \\nsattler has a much smaller part in jp  but is still present to tie this story to the first  \\ncuriously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance  \\none thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other  suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time  \\nthey did not appear to be conversing in the previous films  \\nof course  these raptors look a little different also  so perhaps they are a different related species  \\nnot only are they more intelligent than in the past films  they are also more sympathetic  \\nin this story they are not just killing machines  they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition  \\nthis time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized

and presumably more nasty  \\nit has a crocodiles head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright  \\nperhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs  \\nsometimes they just move too fast to see  \\noccasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision  \\na few times we get unconvincing matte shot  particularly of the laboratory  \\nbut there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films  \\nthe musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williamss score for the first film  \\njoe johnston  who directs  already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky  \\na team including alexander payne and jim

confrontation  everybody loses  and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire worldassuming the world survives  \\nthe ideaand perhaps the only real optionis to avoid war at all costs  \\nthis is the theme of sidney lumets  failsafe   a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler  \\n  failsafe  takes place during the heart of the cold war  the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis   when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word  communism  \\nthe premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws  \\nfive u  s  bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america  \\nthe unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner  but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers  \\nsuddenly out of contact  and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives  the bomber pilots cannot be recalled  and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike  \\na great deal of  failsafe  s plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u  s  bombers from reaching russias bordersat any cost  \\nthe plot is compelling  and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios  \\nthe reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails  \\ngeneral bogan  frank overton   taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself  henry fonda   is powerlessthe fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated  preprogrammed system that may not be stoppable  simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a nowin situation winnable  \\nthe events in  failsafe  are fascinating because theyre anything but predictable  but the real reason  failsafe  works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot  \\na key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war  communism  the cold war  and the united states role in all of it  \\nmost of this is through the films use of the character groeteschele  walter matthau   an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who  incidentally  is on the presidents advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war  \\nmany of the films most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices  \\nearly in the film  he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of  strategy  in a nuclear assault to  minimize  casualties  \\n  whats the difference between  million and  million dead   \\na guest asks impatiently  \\n  forty million   groeteschele responds wryly  \\nthe problem with groetescheles mindset is that he  believes  nuclear combat to be a viable method of war  \\nthe only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals  \\ngroeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over  \\nyet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off  as general black  dan oherlihy  has often recommended  \\non the contraryaccording to groeteschele  that would lead to russia having  more  nuclear weapons than the u  s   which would clearly put america at a disadvantage  \\nsuch a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race  \\n  failsafe  clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war  and  likewise  it becomes a central theme in the film  \\nwhy continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over  \\nis it wise  \\nis it even logical  \\nno  not really  \\nalthough  failsafe  is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism  there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial  onesided sort of way  \\nagain  this is achieved through groeteschele  who is easily the films most important character in terms of the largertheme significance  \\nin addition to providing the central  pronuclear war  voice that the film warns against  he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism  \\nthe context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib  \\none of groetescheles  logical  trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that its merely absurd  \\nhe labels the average marxist an  unfeeling  calculating machine  that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself  \\ngroeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u  s  drops the warhead on moscow  the soviets will  instantly  surrender  for to retaliate would invite countermeasures that would further destroy russias home soilwhich must be preserved at all costs  \\ngroeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions  general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revengeas any normal person would  \\nthe irony here is groetescheles own mechanical theorizing  \\nhe is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesnt even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns  \\nonce the film makes it evident that turning the u  s  bombers will be impossible  the question becomes what the  consequences  of destroying moscow will be  \\njust how will the soviet unions leader react  and what can the president do to convey his best intentions  \\n  just  how  does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an  mishap    \\nwith the help of his translator buck  larry hagman   the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader  in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity  with lumets long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame  exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader  \\nwithout getting into too much detail  i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly  yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances  \\n  that is  as sensible as a nuclear  incident  can probably be   \\nit does accomplish what it must  it avoids an allout war  something that simply isnt possible because of its alltooreal consequences  \\ndramatically  the ending is quite powerful  and the use of oherlihys character as the symbolic  matador   providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the films opening   is particularly appropriate  \\n  failsafe  is a production of a major hollywood studio  released by columbia pictures   and it has the structure of a hightension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film  \\nnevertheless  under lumets direction and walter bernsteins intelligent adaptation of burdicks and wheelers novel  the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded  \\nthe film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming  \\nbut it was the conscious  human choice to  initialize  this automatic arming that  failsafe  also finds dangerous  \\nin retrospect  the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century  \\nits just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down  rather than continuing groetescheles dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown  \\n',\n",

the famed wife of argentinian dictator  juan per  n  eva  who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention  much like the woman playing her  madonna  although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent  among other things   \\n  evita  deals with the rise and fall of eva per  n  a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan  jonathan pryce   then died at the young age of   creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di  the two do share a bit in common  although it wasnt like di slept to  the top    \\nwebber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals  but they always have a point for doing it  \\nhere  they wish to expose her for what she is  but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks  her lying  and covering up for her fascist husband  but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions  and her death was very sad  \\nits also a musical  with almost no words not unsung  \\nthe film plays like a rock opera  much like their  jesus christ superstar   with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals  even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics  which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience  but also a very entertaining one  \\nafter all  this is a musical  and webbers musicals never undermine this  \\nthey are a balance of energy and intellectual depth  walking on a fine line between the both  and never stumbling on either side  \\nthis is why the beginning of  evita  is kind of a letdown  \\nokay  it is a letdown  \\nim not saying the opening moments are bad  because theyre pretty good  \\nbut what comes after is a lifeless  unentertaining  and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer  jimmy nail  into taking eva to buenos aires after a onenight stand  \\nin the musical  its a fun  energetic sequence  culiminating in the show stopper   buenos aires   which is also lifeless  \\nthen a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer  instead of her leaving him  where she ends up singing the sad tune   another suitcase in another hall   which was meant for a later character  screwed over by eva  \\nthe portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft  seeming like parker and oliver stone  who adapted it for the screen  are afraid to present her for what she is  even while its being narrated by a hater of evas  the omnipotent  antonio banderas   who presents her in a negative light  \\nfor a while  it looks like alan parker cant pull it off  \\nhowever  the film pulls itself together in a flash  and after that song is over  and the giddily nihilistic song  goodbye and thank you   where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend  is magnificent  darkly comical  and just gleeful  \\nfrom this point on  the film is hypnotic  satisfying  and satirical  \\nno more punches are thrown  and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact  \\nwe see eva woo and marry juan  get him out of jail  rise to stardom  falter a bit  come back  and then gradually die of cancer  i think it was because of cancer   \\nmore importantly  many of the themes from the musical carry on with this  as well as some fillinginthegaps reconnassaince work  \\njuan  who is pretty underwritten in the musical  is given some extra scenes  and exposed as what he was for eva  an accessory  \\na muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan  and understand his sadness more than we did before  \\nfrom the  goodbye and thank you  number on  the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation  and saved a government  even while it left the nations people downtrodden  \\nbut despite this  the nation still loved eva  and when she slipped into death  the world mourned her because she was a star  \\nthats when our narrator  ch   comes out to show that she wasnt the great woman she really was  and expose her fame  \\ndescribing this character is difficult  mainly because he has no real realistic background  hes said to be based on the revolutionary ch  guevera  but the two probably could have never met  like they do in the film   but he serves as a perspective on eva  but even his perspective cant help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death  \\nalan parker  no stranger to bizarre musicals  hes done  fame    the committments    bugsy malone   and  pink floyd the wall   the latter which is absolutely brilliant   nails the film  exposing everything for what it is  \\nwe cry for evita at the end because we feel we should  by the way it is presented  \\nhis direction is manipulative for a reason  to show the mourning for what it is  \\nand there is energy throughout  with lots of bright colors  and scenes which are cinematically entertaning  as well as enriching and deep  such as the balcony scene where she sings  dont cry for me  argentina   and her death sequence  which is poignant becuase of how sad it is  \\nmadonnas golden globe winning performance is much like the movie  starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly  remaning there for the rest of the film  \\nat the beginning  she looks like shes too busy concentrating on her singing to act  but she eventually gets it right  though never really getting the presence of  say  patti lupone  who did the role in its american premiere back in the late s   \\nher death  though  is brilliant  \\nher singing could be better though  \\ni know she took lessons to improve her range and all  but it still sounds like shes trying to hard  \\nshe sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding  like    patti \\nlupone  i heard her sing on an old  evita  cd  and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her   \\nbut its generally very good  although not up to the brilliance the role really requires  \\nantonio banderas  who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days  im one of the few people who thinks he rocks   is extremely comanding in his performance  presenting a lovable narrator  \\nhis singing is very good  though nothing compared to the original  mandy patinkin  \\nhe does have a pretty good singing voice  and a great range  \\nand jonathan pryce is pretty awesome  although very brief at times  in his role as juan  seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade  \\nalthough it gets off to a rocky start   rocky  s polite for what it really is   it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical  \\nlike the other musical released in   woody allens  everyone says i love you    its a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead  but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance  \\n',\n",

       " 'known as the most successful  highestgrossing romantic comedy in history  director garry marshall apparently struck gold with  pretty woman   which opened quietly during the summer of  but  thanks to positive wordofmouth  was able to reach upwards of million in theaters alone  \\nthe question of why it worked so well lies directly with the films two charismatic stars  richard gere and julia roberts  since the story itself is none too original or even believable  \\nthe other winning element that makes  pretty woman  so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence  which is rarely as palpable in todays films as it is here  \\nedward lewis  richard gere  is a suave  extremely wealthy business mogul who  at the start of the picture  breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument  and abruptly takes his friends car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel  \\nstopping the car along the street  he asks a woman  obviously a prostitute  for directions  \\nagreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks  edward ultimately accepts  they strike up a conversation  and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor  \\nthis meeting does not lead to sex  however  as edward confides that hed rather just have someone to talk to  and offers her  to spend the night  \\njust as well  since the hooker  named vivian  is a beautiful  generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear  \\nthe meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned  when edward finally offers to pay vivian threethousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area  keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and gettogethers  \\nsince vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips  which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers  the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act  edward and vivian will finally  truly  kiss  \\nallegedly planned as a grim  downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director   pretty woman  has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale  a la  cinderella   \\nthe premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been  \\nyou honestly dont need a highiq  or any iq  for that matter  to guess how the film will end  and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha  \\nthe supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and lessthangratifying  and the screenplay is no award winner  \\nand yet  amidst all of these qualms and flaws   pretty woman  is an astoundingly charming motion picture  and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers  \\nyoud actually be amazed how far bemusement can go  and there are a few select moments  not even whole scenes  mind you  that are as romantic as anything ive seen on film in the s  \\nadditionally  the film belongs  and its success can be attributed  to two people and two people only  and they are richard gere and julia roberts  \\nplaying sex symbols throughout the s with such pictures as  american gigolo  and  an officer and a gentleman   gere branches out here to play a more quiet  almost shy  but still alluring  character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet  and vice versa  \\njulia roberts  in her breakthrough role after s wellreceived  mistic pizza  and s  steel magnolia   for which she was nominated for an academy award  is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian  who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers  not for her line of work  but more for her sheer intelligence  \\nit would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake  but screenwriter j  f  lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing  \\nafter  pretty woman   roberts  along with meg ryan  became the reigning queen of romantic comedies  with her latest being the justreleased  runaway bride   which repairs gere and roberts together once again   and no wonder  \\nroberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy  but also one who can efficiently do drama  and in almost every film she appears in  it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male costar  \\nan especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his coworkers that vivian is actually a prostitute  and he then approaches her  making sexual advances  \\nno only does this make vivian feel cheap  especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional  eloquent young lady  but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way  and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading  and if she likes this particular path  \\non the more dreamy side  the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold  especially one in which edward enters into the hotels lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress  but also her inner  and outer  glowing beauty  \\nanother subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward  who is asleep  and placing it on his lips  since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days  \\n  pretty woman  does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene  which is a happy ending  as youd expect  and wouldnt have it any other way  that somehow does not work  perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances  \\nthis one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film  though  because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem  \\nhelped along by a warm  memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo  as vivians best friend and roommate  and a fabulously catchy soundtrack  in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movies overall fulfillment   pretty woman  is a sparkler of a motion picture  and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy  \\n',\n",

this review is the longest ive ever written and still only scratches the surface  \\nid recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis   \\nas my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of the phantom menace  how do i even write this review  \\nnever mind the fact that ive been waiting for a new star wars movie since i was seven years old  \\nnever mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released  \\nnever mind that theres so much going on in this movie in terms of plot  action  special effects and longterm story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldnt cover everything  \\nand also like ted does in all of his reviews  ill try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you  the reader  \\nbefore we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film  many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered  to get the specifics of the film  skip this and the next four paragraphs   \\nas has been made obvious for the last several years  another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the missing initial three installments of the star wars series  the first of the films was actually episode four  not one   \\ngeorge lucas  the creator of the series  has probably just assumed most people know the firstproduced trilogy  star wars   the empire strikes back and return of the jedi  is actually the second trilogy  chronologically  \\nin media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order  but i cant recall his reasons  \\nwith this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy  err    \\nsecond trilogy    \\nwell you know what i mean   \\nand in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which  unfortunately  may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution  \\ncritics note   it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed  but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule  \\ncritics note   reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics law of reviewing movies  which as roger ebert coined  its not what a movie is about  but how it is about it   \\nbecause so many outside factors come into play in the films plot and significance as part of a trilogy  and just considering modern society  it again would be difficult  if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story   \\nfirst of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it  \\nwe know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker  who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire  \\nwe know obiwan ben kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of the force in attempts to become a jedi knight  but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the dark side   \\nwe also know something about the force itself  that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it  the jedi   \\nwhat we dont know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy  which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth  \\nto me  this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle  definite order to all the complexity  \\nalso  it seems that were supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended  \\nmost notably  details regarding the emperor from empire and jedi   and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine  \\nfor those who havent kept up with all the star wars paraphernalia over the years  there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor  or his voice at least   \\nwith the phantom menace being the first chapter of a long saga  one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid  including the history behind all the major factors of the series  especially the force and the jedi knights  \\nunfortunately  this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained  \\ni didnt liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness  \\nif youre going to tell a story from the beginning  tell it from the beginning  is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes  through  to clarify the back story even further    \\nbut i digress  \\nive said so much and yet i havent even touched on the specifics of the film itself  \\nall these necessary disclaiming elements should go to show just how vast the story of the star wars series is and this individual film itself  \\nwhat we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three weve come to know and love since the late s  \\nits similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar  but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality  \\nthe basic story is rather sorted  complex and even confusing at times  \\nwere told that an army known as the trade federation has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo  \\nwere not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is  instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly  \\nwere introduced to two jedi  the master quigon jinn  neeson  and his apprentice obiwan kenobi  mcgregor   \\nthe two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planets queen  amidala  portman   \\nthe leader of the federation  an alien called viceroy  is following the orders of a strange  mythical character  an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears  \\nhe is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance  and especially that creepy evil voice of his  he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series  \\nsidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person  \\nclearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity  which is never openly revealed in the film  but should be clear to most viewers  \\ni have a feeling well delve into his background in the next two films   \\nbut it doesnt take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the films story begins to move along  \\nthe film doesnt have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one miniplot and adventure on top of another  \\nthere are so many of these miniplotswithinplots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook  \\nthe other films have relied on this type of storytelling  but because of the limits of the technology at the time  the films screenplays were also limiting  \\nthe sense of limitlessness here is what gives the phantom menace its unique traits  \\nas we already know  the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original star wars trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear andor unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story  \\nand here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of yearold anakin skywalker  lloyd   by quigon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council  \\nto briefly summarize the story  jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidalas spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation  \\ntheir meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force  \\njinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force  and through another subplot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter  more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves  \\nthis also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before  \\nin fact  it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before  \\nthe element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary  \\nby the films third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot  \\nits funny how the reality of the star wars world seems so embedded in mythology  new agelike philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence  \\nnot that this technique hasnt been used in movies and in reallife situations countless times throughout history  \\nand at least its all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter  \\nit does border of the cartoonish sometimes  but thats just the film appealing to our inner child  which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society  \\nthe phantom menace delivers exactly what youd expect from a star wars film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness  \\nso many things in the film weve seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited  \\nbut this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit

similarly indicative of his increasing prominence  while the traditional  a film by wes craven  drapes the films title in the ads  right below it  in equal sized font  yet  reads  written by kevin williamson   an affirmation of the screenwriters contribution to the project which may be unprecedented  \\n  i can envision the board of wga  licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of  a film by  is attained   \\nand  much like mr  tarantinos screenwriting  mr  williamsons work is vaguely unconventional  incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters  \\nin scream  they satirically discussed other horror films  here in the sequel  the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels  \\nscream was written in  during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood  and mr  williamsons rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel  \\nwhile the sequel was planned from the outset  a treatment of scream  was included when mr  williamson sold the screenplay for scream  the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived  and its only at about the films midway point when it becomes engaging  \\nlike its predecessor  scream  opens with a splashy

good ideas  the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with  and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overlynoisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes  the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore  where her performance not only convinced me that she  could  act  but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that ive ever seen   \\nthere are too many knowing  hip popculture references crammed into the scream

keeping you interested in the identity of the killer  \\nhere  and to some extent in i know what you did last summer   mr  williamsons screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery  \\nthe film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements  \\n  it doesnt help matters any that the killers alterego is fairly obvious from the getgo   \\nindeed  the finale plays as fullout camp when the villain is finally unmasked

over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck  and a catandmouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged  although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown  \\nin terms of its characters  the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey  who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music   \\ntheir verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour  an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is wellwritten  and theres a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed  \\non the other hand  sidney is pretty dull here  \\nshe doesnt have any compelling presence  and theres nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that shes the returning heroine  \\ngiven this  and the fact that theres no strong second banana character for sidney  elise neals role isnt nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowans shoes   its no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film  \\nwhat surprises me the most about scream  is its zealousness in decimating its cast  \\nthe films mounting body count bears out the fact that  no  character is safe  well   almost    while in principal i applaud this bold policy  at some point youve got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel  \\n  i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular  whose casting for the next installment of the series wouldve seemed obvious   \\nbut hey  as rose mcgowans character said in the first film   no  please dont kill

film  \\n  shes the only reason id even consider catching flubber   \\nsimilarly  samuel e  wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian  the weary guardian crab  \\nhe easily milks his lovable characters comic moments for all theyre worth  and his rendering of two of the little mermaids big tunes   under the sea  and  kiss the girl   have become the stuff of legend  \\npat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil seawitch ursula  while kenneth mars booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariels father  king triton  \\nin large roles and small  edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal  and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef   the little mermaid is impeccably cast  \\nof course  the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken  music  and howard ashman  lyrics   who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr  ashmans untimely death  \\nnot only are mr  menkens tunes unbearably catchy  but mr  ashmans charming lyrics are fully integrated into the films storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the characters dialogue  and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film  \\nmr  menkens score for the film is equally topnotch  the sequence where eric  voiced by christopher daniel barnes  and ariel tour his kingdom in a horsedrawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr  menkens fine score  \\nit appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypsostyled  under the sea  as joyfully crooned by mr  wright  which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song  indeed  one of the many little joys in screening the film during its rerelease was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune  but my favourite is ms  bensons heartfelt rendition of the ballad  part of your world   an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope  wonderfully lyricized by mr  ashman  which  accompanied by the films most dazzlingly polished animation sequence  packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes  \\nduring the songs reprise  which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in  the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking  and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history  \\nas of this writing  november  has come to an end  as has disneys limited day rerelease of the little mermaid  \\ntheres no question that the primary motivation for  if not the films reissue itself  at least its timing  was to reinforce disneys dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to foxs costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture  anastasia  \\nin every respect  the rerelease of the little mermaid appears to be a success  the films  grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic  million mark  the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video  pulling in close to  million in its opening weekend  and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressivelymarketed anastasia in headtohead competition  it siphoned enough from the fox films opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot  allowing for disneys odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away  \\nbut although disneys motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were selfserving and protectionist  the real winner is the public  \\nany reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one  and its a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen  \\nthe little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disneys modern animation renaissance  and one of the greatest animated films ever made  \\n',\n",

       " 'steven spielbergs  amistad   which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship  then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who  owned  them  is concerned with several different aspects of this story  \\nfirst  the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery  \\nsecond  it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case  including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams  anthony hopkins   \\nlast  and most importantly  it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade  \\n  amistad  succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements  \\ni have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another  antislavery  movie  \\nhaving seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery  i doubted that there was much i didnt already know about it  \\nfortunately  i turned out to be wrong  \\nfor one thing  spielbergs camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders operations in africa  so  amistad  was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning  \\nand some of the images here are  in fact  much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery  \\none scene in the middle  in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their  excess  slaves by throwing them overboard to drown  has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year  \\nspielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would  and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc rating  \\nthe stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians  such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain  whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time  \\nexposing politicians as narrowminded  opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff  of course  but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation  \\nthe film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time  such that john quincy adams  and probably other politicians like him   who clearly disapproved of the practice  was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court  \\nthe biggest success of  amistad  is probably the characterization of cinque  djimon hounsou   who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin  matthew mcconaughey   the lawyer who represents them in court  \\nthrough cinque  we are given a window into the native culture  as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member  or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ  \\ncinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that  again  contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles  \\n  what kind of country is this  where laws almost work   he asks baldwin in bewilderment  when he learns that the case must be retried before the supreme court  \\nspielbergs direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times  such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinques angry outburst in the court room  \\nstill  there isnt enough of this for it to be a serious problem  \\nthe main flaw in this film  which prevents it from earning four stars  is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni cant quite handle all of these issues at the same time  so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie  \\nthis summers contact  for example  dealt with several issues at once  but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and  most importantly  all of them were resolved at once  \\n  amistad  tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams  but it somehow feels a little forced  and in any case the speech itself  which lasts almost fifteen minutes  wears out its welcome about halfway through  \\nperhaps the best way to describe it is this   amistad  is three four star films edited into one  \\nalmost every individual scene works  but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence  and thus is less than the sum of its parts  \\nhowever  i cant honestly say how it could have been done differently  and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film  and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery  \\n',\n",

rather  the world accomodates him  and heals him  \\nalthough de heers touch is at times overbearing  bubbys salvation is touching  what seemd at first a harsh lesson in the damaging effects of the

disneys own formulaic history  and some viewers may feel as if something is missing  \\nartistically  the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork  and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works  it helps to contribute a more authentic  and therefore more credible  nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically  disneyfied  ethnic tale  \\nthere are also a couple of visually standout scenes  one involving the charge of shanyus hun army  which utilizes the same computerenhanced imagery disney

of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films  \\nin an effort to be culturally sensitive  and to avoid a  miss saigon  type debacle   disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asianamerican actors for both lead and supporting roles  \\nin addition to the actors already mentioned  the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong  gedde watanabe  james shigeta  and

\\nhanding over the directors chair to recent box office gem james cameron  who had only made two films previous to this one  pirahna ii  a surprisingly dull film  and terminator  making cameron a household name   the alien series got a facelift of immense proportions  \\ninstead of being a suspensescience fiction film  cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture  \\nwhat results is one of the most terrifying films ever created  \\na film like aliens comes along only once in a while  and when it does  audiences are usually unprepared for it  \\ni never saw this movie in theaters  but i wish i could have  \\nthe terror and fright must have been unimaginable  most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear  \\naliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen  \\nwith a science fiction plot  cameron gives aliens added testosterone  pumping up the action and fire power from the original film  \\nin fact  aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original  \\nperhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the heroor heroine  as the case may be  \\nnever have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film  and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character  \\nsigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about

explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left  \\ndespite stern warnings from ripley  the company remains rigid and wont call the families back  \\nhowever  when the company loses contact with the colony  ripleys story seems much more feasible  \\none of the companys directors  carter burke  paul reiser   wants to gather a team to travel to the planet  \\nthis team includes a buff private vasquez  jenette goldstein   a questionable corporal hicks  michael biehn   and a loyal android bishop  lance henriksen   \\nburke tags along with

newt are the only ones who knows what has happened  and soon  all hell breaks loose  \\naliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scotts version  it also multiplies the number of aliens in general  \\nalien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member  except ripley  who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo  \\naliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens  and as a result  the chills are incredibly heightened  \\nthen again  this is james cameron  the guy who has given us true lies and terminator   judgment day  \\nhe is the best action director out there  topping renny harlin  who directed cliffhanger   and only he could create something as terrifying as this film  \\nit seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes  and aliens has the motherload  \\nwith perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film  aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion  \\ni cant recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout  never dropping for a moment  \\njust when you think the movie is over  something else will occur  and it starts right back up again  \\nwith a seemingly endless conclusion  aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history  \\nthis scene is usually the one remembered most from the film  as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen  \\nusing flawless special effects  the climax is exhausting  leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety  \\nof course  for a film of this genre to work properly  the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see  \\naliens is completely realistic  even a decade after its initial release  \\nthe special effects are wonderfully seamless  with a terrifying alien to go with them  \\none of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music  composed by cameronregular james horner  \\nhorner has created a terrific score  receiving an oscar nomination for his work  \\nnot only that  horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film  or science fiction film ever  and that includes   a space odyssey  which was mainly a compilation of wellknown composers   \\nin fact  the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music  \\nthe production design is incredible  which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy  \\ndark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive  but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from welllit locations  \\nnormally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer  aliens uses lights to scare the viewer  \\nthen  of course  is the cinematography  which uses point of view shots  along with video feeds in order to build suspense  \\nsome of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley  \\nsurprisingly  the acting is not only above average for this genre  but some of the best  \\nsigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley  incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hardedged persona  \\nweaver soars above the rest in this film  but she is supposed to  \\ncarrie henn gives an above average performance for a child  developing a threedimensional character from her quiet attitude  \\nlance henriksen is terrific as bishop  showing that androids dont always have to be flat characters  \\njenette goldstein shows a fair amount of enthusiasm with her role  and steals several scenes of her own  though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isnt fighting   \\nmichael biehn gives a very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film  \\nhowever  biehn does a good job  making it seem original again  \\npaul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director  but reiser manages to pull it off quite well  however  i still see him as paul on tvs  mad about you    \\na very good cast  which also includes bill paxton and william hope  highlights this action film  making it stand out from others  \\naliens is rightfully rated r for violence  gore  language  and terror  \\naliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre  as alien was more of a suspensehorror film  \\naliens pumps up the stakes  and cameron directs it with professional quality  \\ncameron certainly knows how to make a good action film  but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen  \\ntechnically astonishing  aliens only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed  \\naside from this  you probably wont experience anything like aliens for quite a while  \\n',\n",

even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage s productions  \\nthe opening sequence featuring ms  grier wordlessly striding through the lax  funky music blaring away on the speakers  is emblematic of films of that era  \\nthe timeframe for the film is in fact   but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro  \\nof course  nothing in the film screams s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads  and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists  backstabbing  and deceptions deliciously unfold  the strength of jackie brown is the quiet  understated relationship developed between jackie and max  when they kiss  its perhaps the most tender scene of the year  \\ntenderness  in a quentin tarantino film  \\nsure  thereve been moments of sweetness in his prior films  the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer  or even in reservoir dogs  where a deep  unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters  but for the most part  mr  tarantinos films are typified by manic energy  unexpected outbursts of violence  and clever  often wordy  banter  \\nthese staples of his work are all present in jackie brown  but whats new here is a different facet of his storytelling  a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent  and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation  \\nthis effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr  tarantino as simply a helmer of slick  hip crime dramas with fasttalking lowlifes  and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent  hes the real deal  \\nthis new aspect of mr  tarantinos storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character  that of the worldweary  sensitive  and exceedinglyprofessional max cherry  whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching  \\nmr  forsters nuanced  understated performance is the best in the film  he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie  we smile along with him  \\nmuch press has been given about the casting of blaxploitationera icon pam grier in the lead  with the wags buzzing that mr  tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travoltas thensagging career  \\nas it turns out  ms  grier is solid in the films title role  although nothing here forces her to test her range  \\ni do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection  though  shes been working steadily over the years  often in directtovideo action flicks  but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burtons mars attacks  \\nand larry cohens original gangstas  where she first teamed up with mr  forster   \\nof course  its true that her role here was a godsend  a meaty a part as this is rarity for  any  actress  let alone one of her age and current status in the industry  \\nwhile jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone  it marks tremendous growth of mr  tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding  and whose characterizations have never been better  \\nand while the films narrative doesnt really warrant a running time of  minutes  its filled with such sumptuous riches  ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining  inconsequential conversations between the characters  that there wasnt an unengaging moment  \\nwith an impressive trio of feature films

never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun  its too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging  and if it werent for woody allen  it would have been just a really

a career out of gambling  \\nand to take make things  worse  it proves this through its original  fascinating story  \\nthere have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the  noir  mood  that is  the dark  shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life  \\nthis film starts off in the tradiational noir style  introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing  \\nmatt damon stars as mike mcdermott  a something law student in presentday new york city

the look in his eyes  his slow movements  his intricate mannerisms  all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld  literally   \\ndamon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectlygroomed features  but his narration is what brings it all together  \\nhe never sounds like hes reading from a script  nor that hes trying to embellish anything  it just comes natural to him  \\nthe screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood  from the smell of the air  to the logic involved in reading the other guys faces and cards  and all without sounding remotely trite  \\nimmediately we get the sense that poker isnt for gamblers  but for near geniuses with nerves of steel  \\nthe game is a quiet war  with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers  \\nthe gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car  but when it comes to the game of poker  all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man  \\nthe film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the

\\nwhat this film does is use a different medium to tell that story  \\nmike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives  but both share a passion for outthinking the other player who is

of an era for them  a movie which has kept them up nights searching for clues on the internet  talking and tossing around rumors with their equally enthused buddies  and  for kids under   those elaborate plots consisting of buying a ticket to one movie and hopping into  scream  while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only a year or two older than themselves  \\nno need to worry   scream   is endlessly inventive and entertaining  a fine epilogue to the series that made kevin williamson a household name  reinvented the horror genre  and continued in the selfreferential  postmodern tradition of quentin and co  \\nso  how does the story go  \\nas opposed to what some fanatical internet sites would have you believe  sidney prescott  neve campbell   now allgrownup and constantly dealing with her pass in the constantly tormented sector of her psyche  is not living in hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress  but rather in upstate california  living  understandably  alone in the confines of fences and vast security systems  \\nshe works at home as a crisis center affiliate over the phone  \\nbut that    s not where the movie starts off  \\ninstead  in a tactic that reminded me of the somewhat similar  and conceptually horrifying  sequence in  eye for an eye      cotton weary  liev schreiber   now a big star  drives home to his girlfriend in traffic when the killer calls  demands the location of sidney    s home  and  when he doesn    t get it  threatens the life of cotton    s girlfriend christine  and cotton can    t do anything to stop him  \\nthe rest of the sequence is particularly clever  setting up a constant throughout the picture  the killer has a hightech electronic voicechanger that tops that of the first two  \\nnot only does he sound unmistakably like talented voiceover artist roger jackson  ha  ha   he can now easily duplicate the voices of the lead characters  including sidney  and the returned gale weathers  courtney cox arquette  and dewey riley  david arquette   \\nat the same time  stab   the third filmwithinafilm based around the characters and events of woodsboro and windsor college  has taken a less authentic approach this time around in return to woodsboro  whereas the account of the first two films was true  the franchise within  scream  has now become totally fictional  \\nnevertheless  we learn  cotton made an appearance in the movie which is now in production  as himself to be killed off in the first scene  \\nso  it seems that the real killer is offing our heroes in the order in which they bite it in the movie   either the actor portraying them  or the real thing  \\nsometimes both  \\nclever  indeed  \\nbut  who goes next  \\nno one knows  \\nthree different scripts were penned  we    re told  to keep the true finale off the internet  a nod to the  scream   fiasco a few years back  and no one knows for sure which one the killer read  \\nstill  all the while sidney stays concealed in her home  only visiting dad for the first halfhour of the film  while also having horrifying visions of her mother  which takes us back a bit to sidney    s fear of becoming what her mother was   or  at least  what her mother was secretly  \\nwhen sidney finally ventures out to hollywood as the murders become more prevalent  she    s chased onto the set of stab   wandering through  woodsboro   written and directed as an odd  surreal  nightmare indeed  this is one of  scream      s finest moments  \\nokay  over the years  i    ll admit that i    ve become quite the  scream  fan  \\nno  i don    t have the ghostface costume or the director    s cut laserdisc  but i often find myself compelled to pop in the dvd of either member of the preceding duo  and can get quite caught up in the dramatic element of these films  yes  i said  dramatic element    sometimes debating with family and friends the possibilities and endless theories that have become quintessentially affiliated with  scream   \\nthroughout the film  though  i noticed a much more subtle approach than the other two films  \\ngranted that there    s stabbinaplenty going on throughout  but there    s considerably less blood  less gore  \\nhonestly  i like this approach  \\nit    s more classical  more rebellious  constantly demonstrating the capable direction of wes craven  \\nhe knows when to hold back and at the same time makes the movie ooze with energy  illustrating the delicate poise flowing from his years of experience  \\nsome critics have noted that  scream   seems to take itself more seriously this time  maybe so  or maybe screenwriter ehren kruger  arlington road   who took over after williamson had scheduling conflicts  saw an opportunity for true irony   maybe even a little bit of satire   if the film worked in a few more clich   s  \\nwhat puts a damper on this otherwise exceptional and creative film  i    m afraid  is the ending  or  rather  the identity of the killer  \\nit does the job  i guess  accomplishes what it should  bringing the three films full circle  but upon my first viewing it seemed rather dissatisfying because it appears a little too contrived  too arbitrary  after a second viewing  which i endeavored upon due to this recurring disapprobation  the killer    s identity still seems a little too random  but his motivation came across more sound this time around  and the eventual conclusion was ultimately more satisfying  \\nall in all   scream   does not fall victim to the most lamented principle of a trilogy  it is not the worst of the films  \\nas a trilogy   scream  was a lot of fun  refreshing  humorous  offbeat  \\nalmost sad to see it go  \\nbut then  it does seem best to quit while you    re ahead  and  scream   does a

relationship  like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple  geoffrey gaines  stephen ramsey   the medical researcher working for a big corporation called fex and striving to get a patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field  and his artist wife  lillian  miriam healylouie   who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies in order to make the marriage work  \\nand  still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense  of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line  \\nreceiving a summer grant to study  chemoelectric therapy   geoffrey and his wife are hoping that a summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together  as their threeyear marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her  \\nhe has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab  which is off limits to her  as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice  convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses  \\nhis main argument is  that this is what the public wants  they dont want to hear about how some animals had to die because of these experiments  they just want the benefits of science  \\nthat he is depicted as a monster creating another monster  much like frankenstein was created  is the argument skewed by the director against his bad science  science as a business  as opposed to the good science  science that cares about the small farmer   which is represented by the handsome and almost perfect gentleman  alex vine  david   a young ecologist who chooses to work in the field  trying to get the farmers to go back to organic farming  \\nhe is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially  as it is doing irreparable harm to him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached to this new way of farming  methods that have just come about in the last thirty years and are being pushed by the big companies to enhance their profit margins  \\nthe third view in all this is the artists  represented by lillian  who points out that the artists work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly   why shouldnt the same be true of the scientist   \\nshe argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public  questioning what is good or evil in society  something that bad science has completely ignored  \\ngeoffrey  impatient to get ahead with his research  feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on  as he contacts one of the companys higher ups to argue his case  but decides he cant wait any longer for their help  so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester  the gorgeous pet dog of frances  a dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life  \\nwhile out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car  he is spotted by alex and one of his coworkers  and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife  afraid that alex will spot what he is doing  as he rushes away from the area  \\nin the dinner scene that was  unfortunately  flatly done  but was nevertheless the heart of the film  as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat  a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything  \\nthe scientists engage in a rational argument  highlighting their different points of view  while lillian reacts in an emotional way  siding mostly with davids view but coming at it from a much different angle  \\nit was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies  \\nthat the directors point of view is absolutely right  is beside the point  \\nthe point is that the characters lost their humanity and became onedimensional characters  \\ngeoffrey was likened to a hideous monster  alex vine was likened to his last name  the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability  while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art  the inspiration for goodness and beauty  \\nalex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian  as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other  but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them  lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alexs apartment  \\ngeoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy  and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working  as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him  \\nthe relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely  \\nthe dog is discovered by alex and her in a deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it  and mercifully the dog dies  \\nthe only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage  but she also fails to respond to davids loving gesture for her to stay with him  instead opting to head back to the city  \\nthe farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientists lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of a phone conversation with one of the higherups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way  \\nwhat is progress  \\nwhat can one expect out of life  \\nis the small farmer about to become extinct  \\nthe answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art  which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way  \\nthat this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions  leaving no room for deeper arguments  is the shame of this decent and smart film  that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white  \\nno telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in  it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic  \\nthere is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me  as i dont like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically  \\nthat is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit  that inspite of its shortcomings  it was worth seeing because of its visual statements  though they were also not too subtle  they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently  of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them  and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference  \\nthe stakes in this ecological struggle are that high  \\nperhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film  was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene  \\nit was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picassos guernica had for him  \\nboth artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world  and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on  will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on  \\nthe pain that lillian feels  as she forgets about her desires to raise a family  and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song   make the world go away  blares out from the background  after she has learned that frances beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of a husband  all in the name of science  had a raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science  \\nperhaps  the most pertinent question the film asks  requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business  as the question becomes  can science be happily married with art  \\n',\n",

trousers   and  a close shave   \\nthe latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace  gromit  a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures  \\npart of what made the  wallace  films brilliantly entertaining was parks uncanny ability to make an old story seem new  \\n  the wrong trousers   for example  pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks  and  a close shave  owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories  \\nbut in the hands of park and his team  the stories felt fresh and inspired  and not the least bit contrived  \\nnow teaming with codirector peter lord  park has created a similar creature in  chicken run   \\nthe plot is largely lifted from  the great escape   watch for a quick reference to the ballbouncing scene   with some spielberginspired action sequences providing the excitement  \\nthing is  the film doesnt feel like its been lifted from somewhere else   chicken run  feels fresh  alive  like nothing else ever done  \\npart of it is the original idea  who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisonersofwar movie starring chickens  \\npark and lord milk the incongruity for all its worth  the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious  and to them  it is  \\nbut theyre  chickens   so its funny to us  \\nanother thing that helps  chicken run   and most of parks films  succeed is the animators subtle way of giving nods to the very films theyre cribbing  \\nthere are references to  the great escape   obviously  and  stalag    \\nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both  raiders of the lost ark  and  indiana jones and the temple of doom   \\ntheres even a nod to  the blues brothers   if you can believe it  and the filmmakers even get in a little lighthearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor  taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibsons nationality and film history  \\nthe  braveheart  reference is a hoot if you catch it  \\nwhen you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one   chicken run  is downright brilliant in its execution  \\nconsider this  since july of last year  ive seen dozens upon dozens of  blair witch project  parodies  on television  on the radio  and online  \\nout of all those  maybe one or two were amusing  the rest tiresome  \\nwhy  \\nbecause once you got past the thought that  theyre parodying that blair witch movie   most of the parodies had nothing to offer  no insight  no original idea  no greater purpose  \\nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie  otherwise  you got nothing  \\nconversely   chicken run  doesnt lean on its parodies  the film references are never the sole focus of any scene  \\nif youve never seen  indiana jones   the chase sequence is still fun  \\neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is  rocky remains an interesting character  \\npark  lord  and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before its understood  and as a result   chicken run  is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious  but not quite vague either  \\nenjoyment of this movie doesnt require knowledge of film history  but if youve got it   chicken run  is that much richer  \\nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances  and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that its hard not to fall in love with every one of them  \\nginger is perfect  spunky and opinionated  but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind  and julia sawalha  known as the cute mousy girl on  absolutely fabulous   nails it  \\nshe has warm  human chemistry with gibson  whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gungho veneer  \\nthe characters inevitable romance doesnt feel contrived  but sweet  \\npoor mr  tweedy  tony haygarth  suspects the chickens are organizing in some way  but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out  and his overbearing wife certainly isnt any help  \\njane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs  a hen that runs away with most of the best oneliners  all while perpetually crocheting a sweater   and two supplytrading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swingdancing sequence  \\nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something thats baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades  the chicken vs  egg dilemma  \\none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome  but as with most of  chicken run   it comes as a delightful surprise  \\nthe film manages to cross all barriers  it should be accessible to both children and adults  brits and yanks  rats and chickens  \\nthe animation is firstrate  \\nremember that this was all done the oldfashioned way  with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit  and you see just how truly remarkable  chicken run  really is  \\nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios animation great  precise and unwavering attention to detail  \\nas in such topnotch family fare as  a bugs life  or  toy story     chicken run  has something to offer in nearly every frame  \\ncertainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes  but a active  attentive

\\nbut theres no question that grishams work grabs people  \\nlike puzo  grisham is a better storyteller than a writer  unlike fellow hack michael crichton  who is a good idea man but who cant tell a

who at  years old remains one of americas greatest living filmmakers  \\nthe result is a gripping thriller that  while falling short of classic cinema  deserves its place in the altman canon  \\nfrom

even frances mcdormand  \\nand now i can add embeth davidtz  who looks quite healthy in the altogether  \\nthe naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film  \\nis it oldschool sexism  or a clever injoke  \\nyou be the judge  \\nbut back to the picture at hand  \\nin the hands of a mere mortal  the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller  no better or worse than the countless others weve all endured  \\nin the hands of a master like altman  it becomes an exercise in existential doom  in its own way far more successful than scorseses cape fear remake  which tried for the same result  \\nwhat may prevent it from enduring with altmans greatest work is a weak third act  in fact  there really is no third act in grishams

does have its share of silliness  \\nfor example  while beating the crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what hes getting  alain stops long enough to look at his own reflection

isnt really a bad thing  as the songs are very highenergy and catchy  i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day   its just different  \\ndo yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system  because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie  \\nwith each new feature  disney animation gets even better  \\nnot necessarily by leaps and bounds  but since they put out a new film each year  a steady rate of improvement is apparent  and this definitely shows in tarzan  \\nthere are a couple of scenes where the

skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers  and had me thinking this isnt just tarzan  its  extreme tarzan   \\nhowever  tarzan does not seem to have what i call its  chandelier scene   which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort  utilizing a computerassisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking  \\nlasting but a few seconds at most  its been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast  in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail  \\nas usual  the voice talent is up to snuff  convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters  \\nthe one poor choice in casting  however  was rosie odonnell  \\ngoing into the film  i didnt

       " 'according to hollywood movies made in last few decades  life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being  \\neven worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark  godforsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience  \\non the other hand  it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america  because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view  \\nthis film is amarcord   comedy by famous italian director federico fellini  which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages  and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life  \\nthe film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense  \\ninstead we follow one year in s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs  as well as series of local  often very colourful characters  \\nalthough many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator  movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist  year old boy titta  played by bruno zanin  and chronicles his sexual frustrations  obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca  played by magali noel   problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family  as well as troubles his father  played by armando brancia  have with mussolinis fascist regime  \\namarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film  and it probably explains why it is very popular  even among those people who actually dont like federico fellinis work very much  \\nevery member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film  because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible  \\ndistortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film  word  amarcord  is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase  i remember  in local italian dialect  \\nin the same way the word is distorted  so is the past in memories of those who remember it  \\nafter the premiere  fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film  but it doesnt matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellinis childhood or not  any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film  \\nfellinis views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film  \\neven the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images  \\ncharacters look like caricatures  actors playing them often deliberately overact  and women  especially those who fuel tittas sexual fantasies  often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions  \\nevery now and then  scenes that depict s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movies characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters visions  \\nbecause of that  almost everything in this film looks different  and in most cases better  than it would have looked in the real life  \\neven the fascism gets fellinian makeover  fellini views mussolinis totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle  explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history  and opportunity for comedy  \\nwhen fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents  even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour  \\nunlike many of his italian colleagues in s  who had used s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda  fellini doesnt care that much about politics  \\nlack of selfrighteous moral perspective is compensated with fellinis humanistic approach to his characters  \\neach of them  regardless of age  gender  social class or physical appearance  is given opportunity to express his or her views  dreams and fears  \\nfellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection  even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people  \\nbecause of this warmth and democratic spirit  amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of th century  and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable  melancholic and even tragic moments  \\nfellini couldnt produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie  \\nvignettes arent memorable because of the characters only  fellini uses camera  painting film in bright colours  especially in the scenes that depict characters fantasies  \\nfellini also knows how to use locations  whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel  brightcoloured beach or rural countryside  \\neven the downtoearth streets of rimini  where everyone knows everyone  gets magical dimension during the snowfall  \\non the other hand  lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene  \\nthis atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellinis longtime associate nino rota  \\nhis amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable  most popular and most relaxing and

       " 'people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels  stories  comic books or movies  \\noften science fiction aficionados find material  previously labelled as science fiction  to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror  or rather simple technothriller  \\nin such cases  mistakes are understandable  genre boundaries are never clearly marked  \\nbut  i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic  \\nsuch thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago  when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff   film directed by philip kaufman  \\nthe mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits  \\nbut the right stuff film isnt even fiction  \\nit was based on the nonfiction book by tom wolfe  covering the early years of american space program  \\nthe plot of the film begins in  when few people heard of edwards air force base  major test site for experimental planes  \\nthe major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach  mach speed and thus break the sound barrier  \\nmany pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado  \\nbut one quiet pilot  chuck eager  played by sam shaped  succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots  determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records  \\nten years later  soviets have launched  sputnik  marking the beginning of the space age  \\nin order to regain national prestige  us government decides to be the first to send man into space  \\nbest air force  navy and marine pilots are recruited into program  but not yeager  because he lacks college education and desired allamerican image  \\nin one of critics polls the right stuff was named as one among top  films made in s  \\nsuch high position could be explained with the fact that kaufmans film looks quite atypical for its time  \\nwith more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for s and s  age when hollywood used to make films larger than life  \\nbut the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker  \\nphilip kaufman created reputation in s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original  memorable movies  \\nthe right stuff was the last of them  swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual  risktaking  artsy  projects  \\nthe right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film  \\nthe plot is almost nonexistent and not very coherent  the story  featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes  shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots  embodied in yeager  to new generation of the astronauts  \\nthe film also lacks conventional protagonist  yeager  who also appears in small cameo  remains the true hero of the film  but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives  making this movie into ensemble piece  \\nthat gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents  until that specialised only for bit or character roles  \\nsam shepard is great as yeager  war hero whose greatest achievement  breech of the sound barrier  remained obscured in history books  probably due to his own modesty  \\non the surface  he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues  but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases  \\nshepards performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as cleancut marine  and future politician  john glenn  \\nyoung dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper  and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom  superbly played by fred ward  \\nalways reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and  arguably  first american man in space alan shepard  \\nkaufman left room for female talents to excel too  barbara hershey  pamela reed  veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots wives  \\nroyal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher  but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vicepresident lyndon b  johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch  \\ngreat acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufmans superb direction  \\nmost notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time  \\nthe beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert  as virtual unknowns  far away from strict rules and discipline  \\neverything seems natural yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world  \\nin that setting  its quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights  \\nbut the times are changing  ww alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war  and  natural  pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined  conventional pilots  \\ntheir entire lives become focus of media frenzy  and their job is subjected to strict rules  meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats  publicityseeking politicians and uncaring scientists  like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun  played by scott beach  only to preserve their most basic human dignity  \\nthis contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence  while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity   mercury  astronauts receive fame and fortune  although some of them even before going in the space  \\nthose contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufmans superb use of poetic movie language  \\nediting is great  and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion  the same image would be copied in many latter films   \\nalthough kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military  which provided authentic locations and period equipment  he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights  \\nthose effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space  \\nanother fine contribution of this film is  oscar  awarded musical score by bill conti  i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it  \\nit is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy  \\nsome of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period  \\nthis film is great  and its cult status is well deserved  but there are some minor flaws  \\nsome of the  mercury  astronauts arent fleshed out enough  although being played by fine actors  like lance henriksen   \\nfilm also lacks proper closure  \\non the other hand  most logical conclusion of the film  landing on the moon  would require this film to be more than six hours long  \\nalso  some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians  who were portrayed as evil monsters  just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagans america  \\nin some of contemporary interviews  kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible  and in order to do that  he portrayed russians not as they were in real life  but as they were perceived by americans in early s  \\ntime has passed  now we dont see astronauts as heroes  \\nin this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions  those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers  \\nfew young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up  \\nbut this film  sentimental reminder of the times  when future began   perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow  mercury  astronauts footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky  \\nand even if they decide to stay on earth  they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema

so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot   \\ni have not seen  breaking the waves   the other notable film by a member of this group  lars von trier  to be exact   but  the celebration  works exquisitely in this department  \\nit feels like reality  like youre actually watching real people and not actors  and as a major pointer  has been shot on video  \\nas a result  it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual film  but always wanted to  \\nwe see key moments in peoples lives that they wouldnt dare show to the world  and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style  as ironicallyshowmanship as it really is  works perfectly for the nature of the film  \\nthe key  though  to this film  and the reason its not just a cool danish import  is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth  \\nthroughout the film  we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies  a debate so threedimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his thetruthatallcosts reasoning out of the water  \\nof course it was not right for the father to rape his children  and of course  they couldnt have fought back then  and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them  \\nand yes  its thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later  when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier  \\nbut then again  the father  after all  is not a totally bad guy  and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier  we also see a man who has also learned to live with what hes done  and deep down  feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface  \\nthe final scene  involving mortizen and everyone else  is utterly devastating  thanks to him and thomsen  whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex  \\neveryone else is flawless as well  the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them  \\nthe actors or writers have not made the mistake to judge these characters in the slightest  there are no whites or blacks but instead all grays  exactly like life  \\nas such   the celebration  may be the one truly bizarro film of the year  a work of art so eerily close to reality that its utterly disturbing and utterly fascinating  \\n',\n",

role  but instead of being likeable  she comes across as rather robotic  and as such its hard to see why cusacks character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful  intelligent

cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his  though id bet that if laura and natasha switched roles  the result would be more effective  \\nhigh fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances  \\nfears direction is somewhat stilted  and the script is sometimes a little too  and this is a word im beginning to hate to use but alas i must

his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent  \\nhis character  rob  whose sort of like an older  more bitter lloyd from say anything  is funny and tragic

at the aliens here on earth  \\nthe closest  that i have seen anyway  was   a space odyssey  which made mankind an alien race themselves  being dwarfed by the technology which they created  \\nnow comes gattaca  another film about technology reigning supreme  except here on our planet  \\nthe difference between  and this one is simple  gattaca is more frightening  \\nmost of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering  \\nusing this premise  writerdirector andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills  \\nunfortunately  due to a lack of advertising  i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office  \\nsince seeing the film  i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca  \\nlately  however  i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca  \\nmost people dont even realize that it is a film  \\ndespite this fact  i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it  \\nniccols film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter  better produced  and more realistic  \\ngattaca begins in the st century  \\nprocreating is now done in a petri

program  \\none of the directors of the program has been murdered  and the main suspect is one vincent freeman  \\nthe only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman  \\nvincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love  \\nhowever  after his birth  and through several genetic tests  doctors tell his parents that he will have a  chance of a weak heart  as well as poor eye sight and a short life span  \\nas a result  both parents decide to bring their next baby into the world via genetics  \\nanton  loren dean  is produced without flaws  and the competition between brothers spawns  \\nvincent has a dream to fly a soloflight around the titan  the th moon of saturn  but because of his condition  gattaca  and

urine  blood  skin and hair samples  etc   that he will need to get past gattacas tight security  \\nin exchange  vincent will provide jerome with the rent money and friendship  \\nafter the murder  however  his dreams are put at risk due to one of vincents eyelashes left at the scene of the crime  \\nirene cassini  uma thurman  is a genetically flawed  valid  working for gattaca  and she begins to fall in love with vincentjerome  \\ngattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long time  \\nonly two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years  contact and the arrival  and gattaca will rank among them  \\nunfortunately  whenever one intelligent film comes out against special effectsladen films  it normally gets buried  \\nthe second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs  \\nthe orange glow of gattacas scenes are impressive  but the sets deserve most of the credit  \\nthe sets are very well done  creating a futuristic sense  but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers  \\nas we look at the designs  we realize that these buildings arent too far into the future  \\nthis brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day  \\nthe best thing  however  is the plot  \\nthe story is more than your average scifithriller  \\nat its heart  it develops a theme which is never overpowering but is always present  \\nperhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring  \\nwould our society become a bunch of soulless zombies  \\nmaybe human nature is a result of mankinds flaws  \\nif we get rid of flaws  do we get rid of dreams as well  \\nniccols intelligent script handles all these questions extremely well  and the result is an incredibly smart thriller set against a dramatic story  or vice versa  \\nthe power of the actors brings a lot of credibility to flat characters  \\nwhile flat may sound like a poor job on niccols part  it actually enhances the meaning behind the story  \\nethan hawke has developed into a handsome adult actor  giving his best performance of his lifetime so far  \\nhis curiosity and motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents and  valid  peers  \\numa thurman is    well  uma thurman  \\nher character is slightly underdeveloped  but the story isnt about her  \\nhowever  thurman gives a lot of depth to the flat character  \\njude law gives the most complex performance of the film with the most disturbingly realistic character  \\nhe provides several nice touches  and his final scene is a very touching and heartwrenching one  \\nloren dean gives a nice performance in his welldeveloped character  \\ndean is also responsible for some of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie  \\nalan arkin portrays one of the detectives with a little less more excitement than with his psychiatrist in grosse pointe blank  \\nstill  he does a good job  \\ngore vidal and xander berkeley both provide some very good supporting roles  and berkeley also gives a heartfelt discussion towards the end of the film  \\ngattaca is rated pg for brief violent images  language  some sexuality  and nudity  \\ndespite the somber and desolate mood of the entire film  i wasnt exactly prepared for the ending which left me feeling empty  \\nit turned me off slightly  but then i realized that everything turned out the way it should have  \\nif this had been a typical hollywood film  it would have ended much differently  \\nhowever  with all the mindless science fiction films out there  it is nice to have a film which doesnt talk down to its audience  i especially like the ironic title and how it consists of the four letters which make up the genetic coding  g  t  c  and a   \\ninstead  it provides some much needed entertainment which gives us science fiction fanatics just what we want  a science fiction film with morals behind it  \\nwhatever happened to giving the audience a lesson while entertaining  \\nhopefully more writers and directors will learn from gattaca    \\nand hopefully audiences will too  \\np  s  personal note

life  so are the girls who play aloise  madyline sweeten as the younger  and farren monet as the older   \\nnot that they are the only good stars  however  \\njack warden is ideal as jehan  eliciting just the right amount of humor and compassion required for the character  \\n  the scenes involving him and nello are heartwarming  touching ones   \\nalso  bruce mcgill is charming as the kindly miller william  \\nhes another one of my favorite characters in the film  \\nbut jon voight  as i mentioned before  is the perfect choice for michel  \\nhe brings a mysterious  yet gentle performance that makes us all feel good again when he reassures insecure nello that he  can  win the contest  \\nbut what makes this film fun to watch is how welldefined the characters are  and the pace of the story  best of all  it has a happy ending  though i will  not  give it away  sorry  is strong and powerful enough for us to identify with the characters  \\nfor the first time since the beginning of   there comes a film which doesnt rely on popular formula stuff  such as bigbudget special effects  commercial rock soundtracks  or any of that stuff  \\nthis one relies on telling a fully characteroriented story  with just the right amount of heart  humor  and drama  \\nthat  to me  is what makes a dog of flanders all the more delightful  \\neleanor osullivan of the home news  tribune noticed this  and was kind and generous enough to welcome it  for want of a better word  a glow surrounds a dog of flanders  \\nits heart is in the right place and it engages you  \\nyou can guess where the film is going because this is welltraveled territory  but with pros like voight and appealing young performers like kissner  an oftentold story is well worth a revisit   \\nin addition  there were a couple of other enthusiasts  such as chicagosun times and the washington post  you should read their reviews  theyre really positive   \\nother critics  however  were not so kind  \\nstephen holden of the new york times had more than a share of beatings to lay upon a dog of flanders via pen writing  \\nhe found the film to be a sea of sugary bromides and condemned mr  voights character as hopelessly wooden  adopts an accent even more indeterminate than the one he came up with for anaconda   \\nin addition  entertainment weekly slamdunked the film  condemning it as the worst family film of the year   \\nthere have been so many other bad reviews like this  too  \\nmy suggestion  disregard the critics  \\nthey just have a big problem with touching family films  and one should never pay attention to them  \\nthis dog of flanders may only be a little family movie  it probably wont be a big hit in the style of titanic  but then again no other film has been since then   but that is not a bad thing in and of itself  \\nthis is a story that is sure to warm your heart  and that is what really matters about a dog of flanders  \\nit is also one of the better family films around this year  \\nnone of the other films i have seen this year  though they were good  have been so lowkey and touching  \\nif youre looking for familystyle entertainment  look no further than this charming boyanddog yarn  \\ngo see it while you still can  for as i mentioned  it might not be a big bowwow at the box office for a long time  \\nsee it while you can  \\nthere is really no need to compare a multimillion dollar blockbuster such as star wars  episode i  the phantom menace or tarzan  or even the iron giant with a tender  sweet little family movie  \\n',\n",

is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish  \\nsecondly  and along the same line  we cant prejudge a film because of its stars  director  etc  the difference  \\nwell  in the first one

that kind of along the same lines  \\nwhen we compare a certain actor or director or even composers credibility in one film to another they were involved in  is that really fair  \\nsure  in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more  but what about jackie brown  for example  \\nis it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction  just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both  \\ni think it is  and ill tell you why  \\na good critic should be able to view the film from the  average joe  or jane   viewpoint  while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film  \\nsometimes that can be tough  \\n  the acting was superb  but i was bored  or  i loved it   \\nit was sooooo cheezy   \\nmight be used to describe a film  \\nthese are contradictions  and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique  \\nbut which is more important  \\nand which is better  \\nan extremely well shot and acted film that is boring  or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again  \\ngetting back to the point  my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because were reflecting what the public wants to know anyway  \\nevery average person out there whos interested in this film is likely to ask  how does it compare to pulp fiction   \\nand so  as a critic  im already responsible to ask that same question  \\njackie brown stars pam grier  the  blaxploitation  heroine from the s  who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character  \\ntarantinos pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travoltas sudden revival in the movie industry  and with talks of an oscar nomination  the same is likely to happen for grier  \\n  weve made it thru comparison    jackie is a yearold airline stewardess who brings in extra cash  and probably her main revenue  by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie  pulp fictions samuel l  jackson and comparison    \\nordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara  robert de niro   a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years  to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half million dollars  \\ntrouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet  michael keaton  and taken into custody for possession of narcotics  as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed  \\nnaturally this proves an obstacle to ordells plans and  not as friendly intended as wed hope  he posts jackies bail after she is put behind bars  \\nthe thing is  ordell is in this for no one more than himself  and as we learn from his previous actions  hes willing to kill anyone who stands in the way  \\njackie finds herself in a tight squeeze  \\nordell wont think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as shes always done  yet at the same time  a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided  \\nit comes down to a simple question  would jackie rather face ordell or prison  \\nwhat ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help  the law  ordell  or maybe just herself  \\ncoming into play is another s veteran  robert forster as jackies bail bondsmen max cherry  \\nmaxs obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system  and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance  \\nalso involved is ordells  surfer girl  girlfriend melanie  bridget fonda   a ditzy sun bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand  \\nfonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role  but theres nothing more to her  and therefore  she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters  \\nde niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself  \\nde niro is a brilliant actor  but a character who hardly ever speaks doesnt need a de niro to play him  \\ncompared to pulp fiction  comparison    the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable  \\nin pulp fiction  even the small  seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful  complete  and lifelike  whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldnt have suffered much with a lesser talented cast  the exception being grier  \\ntarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind  so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth  \\nsadly  grier too could have received a bit more attention  especially when the story is all about her newlyjarred perception of life  \\njackson teams up with tarantino again  but the chemical reaction isnt as awesome as the first time  \\njules was the rambling  biblequoting hitman in pulp fiction  and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off  \\nand although jackson is really  really good in jackie brown  i dont think hes quite as irreplaceable  \\nin fact  maybe a new face would have been better  \\njackson couldve remained tarantinos jules  and a new guy could have become ordell  forever to remain so in our memories  \\nsadly  these characters are too much the same  except ordell just isnt as impressive  and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules  \\nanother problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning  \\nthis is griers film  so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses  \\nit not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted  but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story  \\nit is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantinos quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style  and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonards novel  rum punch   \\nfor those moviegoers  dont expect another pulp fiction and youll be satisfied  for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of s film making  \\nthe directing has toned down a bit  however  yet were still reminded that this is tarantinos movie thanks to odd splitscreen storytelling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints  \\nso getting back to the question that i began with  this isnt pulp fiction at all  \\nits good  but it isnt anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place  \\nthis is a more conservative tarantino  but not one that wont satiate true fans  \\nif you can realize that this isnt going to knock your socks off  then youll be happy to at least let it massage your feet  \\nafter all  we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy  \\n',\n",

 is not quite as strong since it is not directed with as sure a hand as penny marshall  but is still an intelligent and vibrantlyacted drama  \\nthe film begins as amy  mira sorvino   a stressedout new york architect  decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the country  \\nat the hotel she is staying at  she makes a massage appointment and after a long  soothing session which ends with her crying as a release of emotions  she strikes up a conversation with the handsome masseur virgil  val kilmer   only to find out later that he is actually blind  \\namy doesnt really care if he has a handicap or not  and begins to spend time with him more and more until they finally start to fall in love  \\nonce she has returned to new york  amy begins to research on virgils certain type of retinal blindness  which he has had since three years of age  and out of a stroke of luck  comes into contact with a doctor  bruce davison  who believes he can repair virgils sight  even though there have only been thirty similar cases in history  \\nat first reluctant  virgil finally travels with amy to nyc and agrees to the surgery  much to the hesitance of his overbearing  but loving older sister  kelly mcgillis   \\nultimately  the surgery is a success  but problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees  since he has never visually seen anything before  only touched objects  \\nhe moves into amys apartment and she is eager to stand by him  but virgils maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship  \\non the basis of the overall story   at first sight  is indeed a film that has been done many times before  and owes a great deal to its predecessor   awakenings   \\nwhat will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance  \\nhowever  what helps  at first sight  rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy  \\nusually  romantic pictures are of the shameless puppydog sort  the recent tom hanksmeg ryanstarrer  youve got mail  immediately pops to mind   but with this film  i grew to care more about the characters and their plight  \\nthe film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil  \\nthe massaging sequences were strangely erotic  maybe even more so than the later actual  love scenes   and as their romantic involvement quickly developed  the film was both entertaining and sweet  and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two  \\nthese joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles that they have always known  with virgil completely used to being blind and having a comforting  peaceful life in the country to amys eventful life in the  big city   \\nthe other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board  \\nval kilmer  usually cast in the  macho  type of role  was always believable as a blind person  and playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears  \\nit was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity  but to sympathize with  and he pulled it off  \\nmira sorvino  who made a spectacular debuting splash in s hilarious woody allen comedy   mighty aphrodite   for which she won a

managed to come out unscathed  and it is with  at first sight  that she finally has another juicy role to play  \\nin a truthful climactic scene set in amys apartment between she and virgil  sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today  and has a flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces  \\nkelly mcgillis  who could have easily come off as the  bad   onedimensional sister  instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as a woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother  \\nfinally  nathan lane  who is usually a little too overthetop  is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist  \\nthe one misstep of  at first sight  is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil  \\nvery little is ever said or discussed concerning it  and when the surgery occurs  it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes  \\nperhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more indepth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences  but i would personally take realism  even if it is graphic  any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder  \\nin  awakenings   the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed  \\nbecause of how strong the screenplay  written by steve levitt  is in the way it deals with the main relationship  and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino  the films few problems can be swept over to the side  \\nthe adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin

       " 'jonathan demmes _beloved_  based on the book toni morrison  is a study in skillful literary adaptation  \\non the one hand  the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel  evoking morrisons pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice  \\non the other hand  beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book  favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the storys main events  \\nthis choice is a smartly made one  for it creates an open space in which the storys wide range of emotions can gestate and grow  \\nindeed  the impact of the film is so protracted that much of it cannot be felt until long after the end credits have rolled  \\n_beloved_ takes place in the second half of the th century  during the socalled reconstruction era after the civil war  \\nfor newlyfreed slaves  it is a time of confusion and turmoil  \\noprah winfrey is sethe  a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation and took her children to an ohio farmhouse  where she hoped the terror would end  \\nwhat she did not know was that it would follow her there  and remain with her long after the physical threat had vanished  \\n_beloved_ ultimately tells the story of sethes search for forgiveness  one longhampered by an unforgettable sin  \\nthe film starts off on a dreary day ten years after sethes escape  as a violent  unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse  \\ninvisible hands terrorize her family  flinging objects across rooms  shaking tables  rattling floorboards  \\nsethes sons run away  perhaps for good  leaving sethe and her daughter denver to fend for themselves  \\ndemmes matteroffact handling of this supernatural element is just one of _beloved_s intriguing aspects  \\nall of the characters take for granted that ghosts are real  \\nwhen paul d  danny glover   a former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe  arrives at the house eight years later and is confronted with the ghosts hellish visions  he doesnt run in terror  \\ninstead  he asks who the ghost is  \\nas in morrisons novel  demme quickly establishes that the horror of the story will not come from the fact of the ghost itself  but from the terrifying past in which the ghost was created  \\nsethe is the one being haunted  but the ghost in the house is the least of her fears  \\nin fact  the ghost is one of the reasons she chooses to stay  \\nthe story takes an bizarre turn with the appearance of beloved  thandie newton   a young blackclad woman who appears on sethes front lawn  leaned christlike against a tree stump  \\nsethe and denver immediately take to the rasping woman and try to nurse her to health  \\nthey know not who she is  but that doesnt matter  \\nonly paul d is suspicious of the stranger  \\nlittle does the family know that beloved will bring about many changes  and force sethe to release a guilt she has held onto so urgently for eighteen years  \\nwinfrey is arguably beloveds greatest asset  \\nshe inhabits the role of sethe so convincingly it is hard to believe this is the same woman who shines brightly on a tv talk show  \\nlisa gay hamilton does an impressive job in the emotionally demanding role as the younger sethe  whose appalling actions make her the disturbed woman we see eighteen years later  \\ndanny glover is affable as the sympathetic paul d  as is kimberly elise as denver  sethes wanderlusting daughter  \\nas sethes sagelike motherinlaw old baby suggs  beah richards authoritatively commands every scene in which she appears  \\nthe films least palatable choice of casting is unfortunately that of the role of beloved herself  \\nthandie newton plays the glassyeyed girl with a demented fervor which is endearing at first  but which becomes offputting and unintentionally laughable by the end  \\ndeparting from the honed aesthetic he used in such films as _the silence of the lambs_ and _melvin  howard_  director demme has used a bit of dramatic overstatement to get across the vivid descriptions in morrisons novel  \\ntotemic camera shots and colorsaturated scenery are decidedly uncommon in demmes films  but the few he uses here work to the films benefit  \\n_beloved_s most memorable scenes are those of baby suggs gatherings in a forest clearing  where the bright yellowgreens of nature entrance the viewer as much as suggs words do  \\nfor the most part  though  demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality  \\nthis  combined with morrisons equally frugal method of storytelling  may make _beloved_ somewhat of a challenge to watch  even to those familiar with the book  \\nthough the film compliments the book extraordinarily well  it falls short in allowing the sort of accessibility one usually expects from a film  \\nnothing is spoonfed to the viewer  \\nmorrisons novel is just as enigmatic  but unlike a movie  a book can be put down to allow the various undercurrents and themes to churn and absorb  \\nthe movie begins like _poltergeist_  and ends like _the color purple_  with shades of _the scarlet letter_ and _little women_ somewhere in the middle  \\ntaken as a whole  beloved is a disquieting  oneofakind experience  one to be viewed with guards down and spirits in abeyance  \\n',\n",

       " 'alien  is the only alien film i have seen in theaters  \\ni saw it when i was  years old  and i must admit that i didnt like it  \\nof course  i was expecting aliens again  and i believe this was my fault  \\nin order to appreciate alien   you need to see aliens  but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor  \\njames camerons aliens was an action film  and many people consider it the best in the series  \\ni am among that group  but alien  is an extremely entertaining film  which critics have bashed for its originality  \\nmany thought the final chase scene went on for too long  and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action  \\nboth are untrue  because the film has quite a bit of action  and the dialogue was essential and wellwritten  \\nas for the chase sequence  it was long  but not overly long  creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion  \\nperhaps watching alien  on video helped  \\non the big screen  i was overwhelmed by something i normally didnt see  \\nit was a very dark film  and the language was extremely harsh  \\ni had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities  \\ndont get me wrongim not saying films should eliminate swearing  but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks  it gets rather distracting  \\nhowever  since seeing it again  i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters  \\nas a result  alien s only flaw  albeit a major one  is the underdeveloped characters  \\nwe never really care about any of them  and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie  \\nthere were only two characters i liked  and of course one was lt  ripley  sigourney weaver   although we have gotten to know her through two other films  \\nthe other character was dr  clemens  charles dance   but because we like him  the inevitable occurs  \\nalien  begins exactly where aliens left off  \\nthe prologue of alien  is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher  who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry  \\nwithout using a single line of dialogue  unless you count computer warnings   fincher sets up the entire film  \\nan impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card  \\nwe see lt  ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments    \\n  title     \\na shot of an alien egg    \\n  title     \\nalien legs stretch up into the air    \\n  title     \\nand so on and so on  \\nduring these first ten minutes  i learned everything i had to in order for alien  to proceed  \\nits quite a remarkable opening  and one which will remain in my mind for a long time  \\nbecause of this facehugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens  the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod  and sent down to the nearest planet  fiorina fury  an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison  \\nhowever  the facehugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryotubes  and is sent down with the escape pod  \\nunfortunately  during the landing  all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed  \\nripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery  \\nof course  you need a carrier for this facehugger  and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates  \\nripley is revived and asks to see the ship  \\nafter seeing a mysterious acideaten section  ripley asks to see the dead bodies  and then have them cremated  \\nthis cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films  \\nfeaturing a monologue from dillon  charles s  dutton   a prisoner who has found god  the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dogs demise  \\nits one of the most memorable moments  as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog  \\nand this is where alien  succeeds  \\nfincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films  and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock  in fact  he is the mixture of both   \\nfincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it  and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films  \\nalien  is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images  \\nby doing so  fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise  \\nmany people have criticized finchers filming of the death scene of ripley  i reveal nothing by saying this  as looking too fake  but i enjoy and relish in the portrayal  \\nshowing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch  but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron  a great deal of symbolism is derived  \\ni feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron  \\nhowever  most people seem to want to witness ripley die  which creates a paradox  as she is the character i didnt want to see die   \\nwhy she is killed is one of the surprises of the film  and i dont plan on spoiling that in this review  \\nfrom every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick with you forever  \\nin alien  it was  of course  the moment the alien burst out of kanes stomach  \\nin aliens  it was the showdown between alien and ripley in a machine  \\nalien  has several  but most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley  \\nripley is pushed up against a wall  and the alien stands inches away from her  \\nwhy it doesnt kill her is a shocker  which later leads to a surprise ending  \\nfincher apparently loves to use closeups of actors faces  michael douglas and the clown faceoff in the game in the same style   and by shaving off the actors hair  the only thing we have to look at is their faces  \\nmany critics didnt like all the actors being bald  but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot  \\nmost of alien  works when you take it in context of the story  but when you try to compare it to its predecessors  finchers turn seems a bit gloomy and dark  though thats not always a bad thing  \\nthe plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films  with some major twists  \\nagain  we are setup with several different characters  and one by one  they are picked off  \\nhowever  while the first two had tons of arsenal  especially camerons film   alien  takes place on a planet devoid of human life except for this rundown prison  \\nas a result  no weapons are to be found  \\nthis creates a lot of tension  although i must admit that fincher could have added a lot more suspense  \\nas an alien film  alien  is the worst of the series  but by itself  it is an extremely wellmade motion picture  with a lot more merits than not  \\nthe unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the onedimensional characters  \\ni never was really emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about  \\ndespite this  ripley was the central figure  and thats what is important  \\nwe care for her  even though she began to act just like one of the guys  \\nagain  the technical side of this film is remarkable  and better than the two previous versions  \\nwhile camerons version was a pumped up action film with massive artillary  fincher uses brilliant camera angles  terrific lighting  and moody sets  \\nthe cinematography  by alex thomson  is very well done  with a terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie  \\nthe confusion of the ending draws the viewer in  as we are just as confused as the actors who are being chased around  \\nthe yellows  reds  and oranges of the lights create a dark mood  and by themselves create a lot of suspense  \\nshadows dance on the walls  and yet those shadows could easily be the alien  \\nthe alien is different from its predecessors this time around  and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense  \\nthe camera likes to take up the perspective of the alien  racing after the characters  \\nthe sets are quite incredible  which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien  \\nthe narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways is well constructed  \\nthe sets appear to be in the future  but not too far in the future  \\none of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the alien  nothing surprising there   \\nsigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance  equaling her portrayal of ripley in aliens  \\nshe was snubbed at the oscars for this one  mainly because the film was a critical bomb  \\nher reactions are far more realistic in this film  with her crying over the loss of the little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter  \\nits quite touching really  \\ncharles s  dutton is very strong in his performance as one of the inmates  and i was on the brink of actually caring for him  \\ncharles dance turns in a nice lowkey performance  and as a result  i cared for him immediately  \\nlance henriksen makes a brief appearance as bishop ii  but he was more entertaining in aliens  \\nthe rest of the cast is pretty stale  though pete postlethwaite sticks out due to his recent turns in the usual suspects and the lost world  \\nalien  is rated r for strong violence and language  and sex  \\nalthough it has its flaws  alien  is highly entertaining with rich symbolism  \\nthis film reminds you how much fun it is to spot metaphorical images throughout a movie  \\nwhile kubrick may have a moral message throughout his films  fincher relies on cinematic devices to bring his meanings out  \\nits a film like finchers which reminds us that it is okay for a film to sacrifice quality for quantity  the final scene   \\nin fact  it tells us that we  as a society  have become too critical of things which may happen to look a little  fake   \\nwhenever something looks fake on screen  we immediately point it out as a mistake  \\nbut perhaps it isnt a mistake  \\n',\n",

the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie  although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers  \\nthe story  as has much of patlabor before  centers around the controversial babylon project  a gigantic seawall that will  on its completion  allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay  \\nthis project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists  most notably the house of sea organization  \\nhowever  the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist  but from

central point  is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up  \\nare history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new  \\nthis is a question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabors alternate setting  \\nas far as the technical aspects of the film go  referring to the subtitled version  as thats the only one ive seen

that theyre among the most easilyreadable subtitles ive ever seen for _anything_  \\nlarge enough that they dont strain the eyes  but small enough not to conceal too much of the screen  \\nalthough it does have several action sequences in it  most notably the climactic conclusion  _patlabor_ is foremost not an action movie  \\nalthough it is a superblyrealized film  it relies in large part upon

explained to the viewer by duchovny and others  \\ni know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie  \\nwarning  major spoilers follow  \\nplease do not read  to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming  what exactly is over that hill and what that weird  hummm  sound is all about  \\nyou have been warned  \\nthe xfiles is what a summer should be  \\nexciting  scary  great special effects  unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary  and good performances  \\nthis is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank  \\nfrom start to finish  this movie does not let go of you  \\nwhen i compare it with last summers movies the best way to describe it would be  take the excitement and great score from faceoff and the deadly use of sound from event horizon  \\nthis flick is scary  not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes  \\nin fact  the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue  \\nyou might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd  \\nthe last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid  \\nyou know  when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair  or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt  \\nso yeah  the xfiles is scary  \\nand guess what  \\nyou never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed  computer generated  babyzilla  it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster  \\ndo not think that the xfiles is a monster movie  \\nin fact  the creature is there for maybe three minutes total  \\nno  the xfiles is definately a mulder episode of the series  \\nscully is at his side  of course  but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time  \\nshe has a couple of good scenes with duchovny  but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much  \\nno  this is mulders time in the spotlight  \\nby now  you have heard of the scene where mulder  showers  independence day  \\nif you have not then i will not spoil it for you  lets just say that due to recent events mulder should be  showering  godzilla instead  \\nto those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there    who \\ncares   \\nif he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about  \\nthe dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous  \\nthe camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill  \\nthe script is spotless  every thing that happens happens for a purpose  \\nif you are confused by something  do not worry because it will all become clear later on but  and i cannot stress this enough  pay attention    \\nunlike most summer movies  the dialogue is twice as important as the effects  \\nmiss one vital piece of information and  like most people who talk during movies  you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense  \\nalso  to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies    dont  \\nthe person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation  \\nthere is no time to take a breather between scenes because  again unlike most summer movies  godzilla anybody  \\n  the xfiles does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots  every scene is crucial and serves a purpose  \\nwho needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a  big emotional scene  between godzilla attacks  \\nso far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies id recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose  \\nbut the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie  the xfiles is  \\nwhat more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited  \\ncool effects  \\nits good some  \\npulse pounding  \\nhell yes  \\nstrangely enough  i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while nonfans will have a good time  \\nit does not provide answers to the shows many questions  the status quo remains nearly the same and  no  mulder and scully do not get together  \\nrating  four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer  several jump right out of your seat thrills  many  whoah  i never saw that one coming   \\nmoments  four  holy shit  where the hell did that come from  and one heck of an ending  \\nyou may wonder where this movie lost half a star  \\nwell  i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck  the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop  \\nits pretty obvious the films makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time  but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving  \\n',\n",

       " 'when i left the theater after seeing david lynchs  lost highway   i remarked to a fellow moviegoer   i feel like someone just sucked my brains out through my nose and put them back in through my ears   \\nin his first feature film in five years  lynch delivers a film second only to his debut picture  eraserhead  on the weirdness scale  \\nyou wont  know  what happened when its over  though there are certainly enough clues with which to make some reasonable guesses  \\nit is difficult to describe the plot of this film  because it depends partly on how you interpret it  \\ni can  however  describe what we see on the screen  l  a  jazz saxophonist fred madison  bill pullman  and his wife renee  patricia arquette   whom he clearly suspects of infidelity  receive a series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while they were asleep  \\nthey are  naturally enough  more than a little frightened and confused  and it doesnt help matters any when  mystery man   robert blake  approaches fred at a party and proceeds to call himself on the telephone at the madisons house in a scene that is at once hilarious and unnerving  \\nthe next morning  fred finds another videotape which  to his  and our  surprise  shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom  \\nhe is convicted of her murder and sent to death row  where he inexplicably disappears one night and is replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton  balthazar getty   \\nthe perplexed prison officials release dayton  whose life begins to intersect with fred in a number of ways  most notably his affair with alice wakefield  arquette again   a blonde who is otherwise renees spitting image  and another encounter with the mystery man  \\ni would be giving away a little too much to reveal any more  but suffice it to say that lynch doesnt offer any neat wrap  ups  nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion  the cinematic demons of  lost highway  are out in full force from beginning to end  \\nthis description might make  lost highway  sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism  but in fact  while there are traces of lynchs weird sense of humor  this film is anything but giddy most of the time  \\non the contrary  lost highway is a dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynchs previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther  \\nthe film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery  rather  the character  is  the mystery  \\nthere are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion  distrust  and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded  fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goingson here  \\nwe  the audience  are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this  probably freds  in my opinion  and what  in that case  the other characters and events are meant to represent  \\nall of this proceeds  appropriately  in lynchs typically slowpaced  idiosyncratic style  \\nas is often the case  lynch relies on sound  imagery  and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story  and in  lost highway  it works perfectly  \\nthere are scenes when the camera lingers on freds blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway  or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coils  song to the siren  can be heard faintly in the background  nothing is technically  happening  in these scenes  yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as  if not more so than  the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity  \\nlynchs direction and director of photography pete demings darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear that are exactly what is needed for this story  \\nwell  most of the time  anyway  i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist  which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewers attention because of its tieins to the original mystery  \\nthe main characters in this  reality   dayton  a wellmeaning but none too intelligent yearold   a sleazy gangster  who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much a stock character   and his pornstar girlfriend  the blond arquette   are nothing you couldnt find in any of the two dozen  pulp fiction  wannabes  fortunately  the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements  such as the strained  awkward conversations between pete and his parents  help to preserve the films spooky  unnerving tone during this stretch  \\nlynchs typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality  while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery  are also somewhat overdone here  \\nits not exactly exploitative  like almost everything else in this film  the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills  as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off  \\nthat said  these minor flaws dont prevent  lost highway  from attaining its place as one of the darkest  most unsettling films to hit the screens in recent years  \\nit is a oneway ride down the lost highway of a disturbed mind  and as such it is gripping  intense  and brilliantly effective  \\n',\n",

significantly more plot and dialogue  \\nwhile we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex  we also have a skimpy little plot going on  mostly towards the beginning   and maybe just a hair of characterization  \\nnot to mention the acting is generally pretty good  and we dont really see a lot of the actors completely exposed  \\nbut what makes it supremely different from a porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience  \\nthis film does not posess the erotic hypnotism of  henry and june  or the just plain horniness of  say   deep throat   not that ive seen it   \\nif one was to be made completely hot by this film  it would probably mean they were also into the whole  auto eroticism  thing  \\nthe film leaves you cold erotically  and maybe in many other ways   but what it does is present a group of people who live on the edge  \\nthe film opens up on a woman  catherine  deborah kara ungar  of  the game    pressing her bare breast up against a car in a public air hangar  \\nsuddenly  a man enters the frame and begins to take her from behind  the film doesnt show all this though  even if it is nc   \\nthe next scene has a film director  james  james spader   having sex with a camera woman  alice poon  in an office on the highlypopulated set of his movie  \\nthe next scene has the two coming together  revealing to us that theyre husband and wife  and them sharing in one anothers escapades  \\nwhile the two are arguably freaky people  we at least know they love to live on the edge  \\nsoon afterwards  james is driving down the road at night  reclessly of course

leaving the driver  helen remington  holly hunter  in a porn    also alive  \\nthe two go through therapy together  and when getting out  they run into eachother again  \\nwhen james gives her a ride home  they almost get into another accident  and immeadiately afterwards  they go to an unbusy parking lot  and have a little quickie  as they were aroused by the accident  \\nyou wouldnt think there would be many people who shared this same kind of fetish  but they run into a freaky guy named vaughan  elias kosteas  and his crutchcarrying girlfriend  gabrielle  rosanna arquette   who are also into it  \\nvaughan is into living on the edge as they are  but he takes it to another level  he loves to recreate famous car crashes  \\nin one scene  he and a friend  colin seagrave  peter macneill  recreate james deans car crash without any padding or safety belts  and suffer some concussions  but nevertheless get a rush  and the attention of the police   \\nsoon  these five are all having sex with one another  be it straight  gay  or lesbian sex  \\nwhile this is admittingly all a bit comical  the film is almost like a black comedy   the film does do a pretty awesome portrayal of people whos main fetish is living on the edge  \\nim sure somewhere there are people who get aroused by car accidents  but i personally dont see a connection between car crashes and sex  \\nthe main connection cronenberg shows us that both give a definite rush  \\nhis car crash scenes are quick and exciting minimasterpieces  were at first not sure if theyll take place  but everytime it looks like it may occur  we gasp  \\nthen when it happens  we hold our breath  \\nthe same thing happens with sex  although not in the same fashion  \\nthese people are merely taking it to another level  \\nthe only problem with the film is that its a tad redundant  \\na normal porn lasts from an hour to an hour and a half  \\nthis goes on for about  minutes  and it just seems a little too long  \\nthe sex and car crashes are far between one another  and the time between them are a tad on the boring side  \\ntheres no characterization  although it could definitely be argued  that hey  its a porn  and were not here to sympathize  \\nbut still  they coulda cut it down a bit  \\nbut the film is saved with its presentation  as well as some other elements  \\nthe atmosphere is very dark and forboding  creating a kind of cool weird feeling  \\nand there are several scenes are just amazing  \\none scene has catherine and james having sex  while she softly asks him questions about being with a man  which sounds almost erotic the way she says it  \\na sequence involving one characters death is filled with all the edgy disjointment that the film needs  \\nand the final shot is shot perfectly  creating an image of a car crash  and a couple having sex in front of it  despite the fact that shes wounded  \\nthe acting is also pretty good  especially for what is almost a porn  ousting linda lovelace as best actress in a porn   \\nwhile james spader is pretty boring  hes usually pretty intense   deborah kara ungar is amazing  \\nshe speaks all her words in almost zombielike hushes  and when shes having sex  she has a blank look on her face  not showing the viewer whether shes enjoying it or not  \\nin one scene  she actually looks dead while someone is having sex with her  \\nholly hunter  who gets extra credit just for appearing in something like this  is pretty good  and so is rosanna arquette  who adds a kinda cool kinkiness to her role   \\nbut the film is stolen by elias kosteas who plays his character so intensely that he almost upstages everyone  \\nhe often speaks as he is out of breath  showing a definite affinity for his way of life  \\nhe has a great deal of energy in several scenes  especially one scene where hes taking photographs of a picture  and a later scene where hes getting a freaky tatoo  \\nhe and spader share sexual chemistry in several scenes  foreshadowing a later scene  \\nkosteas is a little known actor  his biggest role was casey jones in  teenage mutant ninja turtles    but here he shows a denirolike presence  hinting that hes capable of bigger roles  \\nwhile i hardly enjoyed  crash   its still a pretty intriguing portrayal of a group of people who  if the exist  are some of the strangest and most bizarre people in the world  \\nthese people are able to share a rush between two completely different entities  and the film  which doesnt exactly pain them in a negative light  is sucessful in bringing them to light  even if it

emotionally involved  whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of roses overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack  or that jack would rescue rose  or that they would both survive  \\nperhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk  and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface  \\nthe bit where rose lets go of jacks hand  while promising shell never let go in her heart was particularly heartwrenching  and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image  to put no fine a point on it  \\ni loved the ending  however  which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half  \\nso  weve established that the film is powerful and moving  if the last hour was rather excessive  \\nhavent mentioned the script  \\nplotwise its ok  though the jackrose relationship was beautifully developed  but ive a feeling thats to the actors credit if anything  \\nas for the dialogue  well  titanic is set in   \\nits a period drama  \\nbut i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned  \\ndid they really use phrases like  goddamn it   \\nback in the turn of the century  \\ni doubt it  \\nwould someone talk like this   do ya love the guy or what    \\ni doubt it  \\nis such dialogue as  i saw the iceberg  and i see it in your eyes now  not just a bit  clumsy  \\nyes it is  \\na little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray  and cameron himself is to blame  he wrote the script   \\nstick with directing  dude  \\nbut its more than redeemed by the acting  with dicaprio and winslet on fine form  ably supported by a strong cast  \\nstar of the show was gloria stuart  though  why didnt she win that oscar   \\nafter all  they were throwing oscars at  titanic  left  right and centre  but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee  \\ndirectingwise cameron does a spectacular job  \\nlike i said  his vision was a bit excessive  but at least he directed it well  \\ni havent even mentioned james horners beautiful score  \\nutterly heavenly  though when your dad

best films of alltime  \\nnope  i dont think so  \\nits certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films ive ever seen  but i dont think it quite ranks as one of my alltime favourites  \\nand as

such a strong impact on me like george lucas epic  \\nstar wars wasnt just important movie for me  or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment   \\nit was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema  \\nuntil than  american motion picture industry was in a limbo  social turmoil in s practically destroyed the old hollywood  and new authors filled the void  mostly by using hollywoods financial and technical resources to create serious   personal  or  artsy  movies  \\nas a result  audience  traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate  didnt want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen  \\ngeorge lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue  \\nthe audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm  and huge financial success of the movie  later backed by supplement industry of toys  books  comics  role playing games and other merchandise  slowly began to change the face of hollywood  \\nserious  adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion  and were replaced by industrial products of  blockbuster  philosophy  \\none of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre  \\nuntil   science fiction movies were mostly in bproduction domain  \\nin late s  bigger budgets for science fiction didnt look so strange anymore  thanks to the great success of   a space odyssey  \\nbut the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism  and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production  mostly dark  dystopic movies  \\nhowever  in  star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies  even among the audience that usually doesnt like it  \\nas a result  seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away  although some good  dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early s  \\nafter that  science fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment  \\nironically  the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of  new hollywood  generation of young movie authors who made  artsy  and  personal  films in early s  \\ngeorge lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx   and nostalgic drama american graffiti  \\nboth movies were considered  personal  in its time  despite latter one becoming very popular  \\nin a sense  star wars is an also very  personal  film  and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it  not for it  \\nbut unlike many  personal  movies of the era  its  personality  was in line with the wishes of the general audience  \\nthe plot  set  a long time ago  in a galaxy far away   begins in a time of civil war  \\nthe evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the old republic  \\nin order to quash any opposition  the empire had built death star  superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planets  \\nthe information about death star  acquired by rebel intelligence  is being transported by princess leia organa  carrie fisher  when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser  \\nprincess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader  played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones   but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots  cpo  anthony daniels  and rd  kenny baker   \\nthose two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker  mark hamill   young restless man who wants to leave his farm and become space pilot  \\nhis adventure begins when rd escapes  because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi  alec guiness   \\nold man is actually the last surviving jedi knight  member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force  \\nafter some hesitation  luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess  while the old man would teach him the ways of the force  \\ntheir small band comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely  where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo  harrison ford  and his furry sidekick chewbacca  peter mayhew   \\ncritics who dont like the movie  especially those who cant forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of  new hollywood   are prone to point the lack of originality  \\non the surface  they might be right  lucas himself admits that he found a lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood  westerns  wwii aviation movies  old sf cliffhanger serials of the s and s  yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawas samurai classic the hidden fortress  \\non the other hand  those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further  into collective subconscious of western civilisation  hinted by some mild tolkien references   \\nthe others would find the authors element within the story  star wars could be seen as an anti establishment film  young  longhaired  easy going  natureloving heroes are fighting against old  uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes  \\neven out of its historical or social context  star wars is an impressive as a strictly technical piece of the seven art  \\ngeorge lucas direction is very good  with the clever editing and a wellpaced segments between action and dramatic buildup  \\ncharacters are welldrawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients  both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster  \\nwe have a  comingofage  hero  damselindistress  somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time   reluctant helper  benevolent mentor  diabolical villain and  finally  comic relief in form of two nonhuman characters  \\nsome of the actors are very good  alec guiness in his most famous role to date  james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease  peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form  \\nunfortunately  the same cant be said for the main leads  among the main trio of mark hamill  carrie fisher and harrison ford  only the last one had the character threedimensional enough to launch his further acting career  \\nthe thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology  \\noften comparisons with   space odyssey  another groundbreaking sf film  were citing the sheer number of effects as a proof of the lucas superiority over kubrick  \\nhowever  the special effects by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive  even after two decades  although  special edition did improve them significantly   yet they arent the most remembered trademark of the movie  \\nthat honour should definitely go to the  oscar  winning soundtrack by john williams  whose work on star wars is probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career  \\nnewer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough to witness star wars original release  \\nyet  even if they are immune to the george lucas magic they should watch this film nevertheless  perhaps only to become familiar with something that is essential part of contemporary culture  \\n',\n",

heightened anticipation  \\nthis is  after all  the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction  \\nto say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood  since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio  desperado  four rooms  and from dusk til dawn  \\nhe was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide  \\n  im willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him   \\ntarantino contributed on and off screen to these films  but never took the directors helm  \\nnearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more  tarantino returns with a film he can call his own  \\nthe film opens up with an homage to the graduate  with jackie brown  pam grier  on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her  \\njackie is a flight attendant for air cabo  which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas  \\nthis makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi  samuel l  jackson  who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico  \\nhowever  while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u  s  for ordell  jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus  michael bowen  and atf agent ray nicolet  michael keaton   who catch her not only with the money  but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs  \\njackie didnt know they were in the package with the cash  but thats of no consequence to the authorities  who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted  \\nof course  dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish  ordell  \\nordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry  robert forster  to get jackie out of jail  but while max is immediately attracted to her  jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety  since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police  \\nsure enough  ordell shows up at jackies apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good  but she  borrows  maxs pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell  \\ninstead of closing the irony circle and relocating a bullet from the pistols chamber to ordells head  jackie proposes a deal  \\nsince ordell wants to get his money out of mexico  jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier for him once more  but this time for a more substantial fee  fifteen percent of ordells half million dollars  \\nwith a gun in his face  how can ordell not agree  \\nby itself  this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film  \\nhowever  we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think  \\njackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell  but shes also making a deal with the feds as well as with max  \\nthe film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham  but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around  \\ninstead  its actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of todays movies  \\nat least this film has a little imagination  \\nmost of the performances in jackie brown are above par  \\npam grier  of whom i had never taken notice before  plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable  \\nsamuel l  jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control  \\nrobert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy  trying to do his best   \\nnever mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guys apartment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course  \\nhes just so downtoearth  the nature of his job really doesnt occur to us  even when were shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison  or when we see the tools of his trade  \\nin supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara  a recently paroled friend of ordells  and bridget fonda as melanie  one of the girls ordell keeps around town  \\nunfortunately  de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between  and then they are mostly clipped sentences  \\nin this film  hes not really de niro  but stereotypical de niro  uttering things like   little bit   and  pretty much   \\nfonda  on the other hand  plays the slightly spacedout melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness  such that even when she is annoying louis  we are taking her side  \\nas is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a hand  the dialog is quick and snappy  \\nit grabs our attention and is actually interesting  and in many respects  this makes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals  the lines are a form of art in and amongst themselves  \\ndont count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera  however  \\ntheres a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange  and hes not really sure whats happening  but by composing the scene just so  his realization of whats going on is felt simultaneously by the audience  \\nwe look at the screen and think   gee  thats clever   and then think the same thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on  \\nalthough tarantino isnt afraid to drag out a shot for dramatic effect  it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film  \\nthere are shots where a character is simply driving  and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head  \\nthis is a tribute to both direction and acting  \\nhowever  there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through a mall  and she is looking for something  desperately looking for something  \\nwe get the idea of the frantic nature of her search  but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what shes looking for  but instead hoping shell just stop  \\noverall  viewing jackie brown is time spent well  \\nsome flap has already been made about the language used in the film  but its really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today  \\nin fact  one might even be able to say that the way in which these  offensive  words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness  \\ngo see the film and see what i mean  \\n',\n",

rating  but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour  \\nafter subsequent viewings  i feel that independence day really wasnt as great as it seemedthough i still give it a positive review  \\nstarship troopers  on the other hand  has a mocking sense of humor  knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem  \\nas a result  starship troopers is a more exciting  energetic  and lively science fiction film  \\nin fact  i probably could never get tired of watching this film  \\nstarship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars  another kickass space opera which reinvented the scifi drama altogether  \\nwhile starship troopers is no star wars  it comes quite close  and the easiest assessment would be to call this film   the star wars of the s   \\nam i being to generous to this film  \\nperhaps  but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance  effectively  into the warring races  \\nin essence  this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction  \\nthe easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films  and i may have to  \\nstarship troopers is not quite an original film persay  but director paul verhoeven gives the film a  kickthealiensasses  style  \\nid had this same style  except it was forced  most likely the cause of will smith having a major role  \\nthis new  star wars  has a very simple  basic plot  mankind vs  an alien species  \\nthe alien species in question here is the bugs  a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnidtype insects  \\nhowever  the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy  \\nsometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes  but during quiet moments  we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization  \\nmore than likely  these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends  \\nand they should be  \\ni doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thoughtprovoking film  \\nthis is an  event  film  but surprisingly above average  \\nit is extremely refreshing to watch a scifi war film  and actually root for the human side  something independence day never achieved   \\nstarship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange  join the army  ads  \\nmixing a webbased interface  these summations of events are refreshingly original  \\nstating   would you like to know more    \\nthese short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor  and we know we should not take it seriously  \\nhowever  we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle  in a gory  yet funny  way  \\nafter witnessing the slaughter  the film jumps back one year  to setup what we just saw  \\nwe are introduced to johnny rico  casper van dien  and carmen ibanez  denise richards   \\nrico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms  \\nhowever  carmen isnt as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot  \\nhowever  another classmate  dizzy flores  dina meyer   has her eye on rico  \\nunfortunately  rico isnt interested in dizzy  \\nthis setup is rather cliched  as is the result of the setup  but it still is fun to watch  \\ncarmen signs up to become a starship trooper  and as a result  rico signs up  \\nand as a result  dizzy signs up  \\neveryone is assigned a certain position in the academy  carmen gets the pilot position she wanted  carl jenkins  neil patrick harris   a psychic  gets a position in the training program  and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers  the mobile infantry  \\nthe main story follows rico through his trials and relationships  \\nin reality  i found myself watching a space version of  melrose place   but with better special effects  \\nan hour into the film  the war begins  \\na sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with  \\nthe first hour may have been a funny  sometimes unintentionally  setup  but we grew to care for the flat characters  because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters  their gorgeous looks won me over  call me superficial  if you must   \\nfollowing the training sessions  which had many dramas in themselves  too many to mention here   the troopers are sent to war  \\nthe bugs live on the planet klendathu  a planet which consists of dirt and rock  and pretty much nothing else  \\nmany dramas occur during the war  until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs attacks  \\na sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense  \\nthe troopers are ordered to locate the  brain  and capture it  \\ni hopefully left the plot as vague as possible  because starship troopers is not about plot  \\nits about special effects and gory violence  \\ndirector verhoeven  most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct  returns to his scifi days  which gave us good films like total recall  \\nverhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa  but despite all the violence  the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood  \\nstarship troopers is extremely violent  with more gore than this years event horizon  \\nthe r rating is well deserved  and hopefully parents will not allow their  year old children to see it  \\nmy guess is that verhoevens target audience is the  to  male group  \\nthe film has a testosterone level off the charts  with chiseled men and beautiful women  \\ndespite these superficial elements  starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful  \\nwhile watching the film  we never second guess the characters decisions because they seem perfectly clear  \\nthankfully  no hero is punching aliens in the face  which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with  \\nthe cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with  but they soon grow on you  \\ncasper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon  \\nto most guys  he will come across as artificial  \\nfortunately  van dien is the worst of the cast  despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character  \\ndina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character  \\nher dizzy is extremely likeable  \\ndenise richards also does a good job  and her scenes are very well done  \\njake busey  gary buseys son  gives a wonderfully funny performance  and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film  \\nneil patrick harris  remember  he was doogie howser  is a little wooden  and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast  \\nhowever  he does give a good performance  \\nmichael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm  \\nhis performance rises above the rest  \\nperhaps it is because his character is the most developed  but i think it is just ironsides presence on screen  \\nunfortunately  no particular cast member gives a starmaking performance  which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars  \\ndirector verhoeven is the main star of the film  \\nhis direction is fast and unrelentless  \\nhe never slows down his pace  which makes for a wild ride  \\nwriter edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein  \\nthe writing is usually very funny  and sometimes very corny  \\nthe dialogue is smart but not too smart  \\nwe arent required to know everything  but some plot holes are left unanswered  \\nthankfully we are not intended to notice  and we really dont  except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while   \\namazingly  with all the wars and romance going on  the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues  \\nin fact  these governmental changes seem fairly plausible  and this adds another layer to the story  \\nthe moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre  but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage  \\ni havent laughed this loud  even in some comedies  \\noh  and the special effects are first rate  \\nstarship troopers is rated r for graphic scifi violence and gore  and for some language and nudity  \\nbelieve me when i say this  dont take young kids to see this film  \\nit is extremely violent  \\nin fact  it is probably the most violent film out this year  \\nhowever  if you are old enough  over   to see it  starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain  \\nits been a long time since i have cheered for the heros  while also cheering for the bad guys  \\nand still  it is my dream to see a scifi film in which the alien race destroys mankind  and take over the world  \\nnow that would be entertaining

project on his shoulders  \\nbut sometimes there is simply no other explanation  and such is the case with  the hurricane   \\nthis biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin  hurricane  carter would normally be called  norman jewisons the hurricane    as per the tradition of referring to a film  belonging  to a director  \\nbut though he does decent work  jewison cannot claim ownership of  the

watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor  \\nnorman jewison directs the film  doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection  \\n  the hurricane  moves quickly  with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely  \\njewison handles his multiple flashbacks well  the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is  and nothing is terribly confusing  \\nhis boxing scenes  constructed with clear inspiration from  raging bull   get inside the action very well  and they are believable as real sports footage  \\njewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick  carter is sent to solitary confinement for  days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform  and jewison  assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington  shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude  and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell  \\njewisons best achievement in  the hurricane  is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hardknock life  and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again  \\nsadly  though  the films chief failures lie with the screenplay  as with most of the goodbutnotgreat efforts to round the pike this winter  \\nthere is much to interest a viewer in  the hurricane   but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich  d route possible  it does  \\ntake a look at

route far too often  \\ni wanted a real reason for the cop to hold a grudge against carter other than  hes a racist pig   \\ni wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice  \\nin short  i wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens  \\ncriticism has been levied against the liberties  the hurricane  takes with the truth of what really happened to carter  and much of it is deserved  \\nfor example  the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello

out of the film  and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained  \\nof course   the hurricane  works mainly as a fable  so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially  but even dismissing such issues dont remove one fact   the hurricane  is a highly flawed film  \\nonly one actor could have made a schmaltzy  predictable picture like this work as

big question becomes  who gets to ride it   \\n  right after  whos gonna pay for this thing     \\nto boil it down  ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism  while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith  \\ndrumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform  apparently to keep  godless science  from talking to god  or something like that   \\nthen hadden reappears with startling news  \\nhe has secretly constructed a second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie  in whom he has taken a rather paternal interest  \\nellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to a dreamlike place that looks a lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels  where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father  david morse   \\nwhen she returns home  no one believes her  \\nshe was not even gone for one second  they say  even though she remembers being gone for  hours  \\nher story is officially discredited  although believed by a large segment of the public  who dont even have to know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing but static  \\n  \\n  \\neighteen hours worth of static   \\nthere is a lot to like about contact so i will highlight those points first  \\nellie arroway is a wellrounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working  \\nneither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs  but thats a tough standard to meet  \\nellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures  \\nher real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally  \\ndrumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble  \\nhadden obviously has affection for ellie  but in the end he seems to see her as his creation  nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board  \\neven palmer joss  matthew mcconaughey   ellies love interest  takes a paternalistic interest in ellie  seeing her as a misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses  \\nthe film is technically impressive  especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine  \\nthe part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in a film since the andromeda strain  \\nthe film falls apart when dealing with its central theme  the dichotomy between science and religion  \\nthis is a very real debate but contact boils it down to a simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved  \\nthe film presents science pretty well  until the end  so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith  \\nreligious people are presented as shallow caricatures  \\nrob lowe plays a ralph reed clone named richard rank  very subtle  guys   the voice of the religious right  \\nanother religious figure is the fanatic who blows up the first machine  jake busey   \\nthe only really fleshedout religious person  palmer joss  is supposed to be a minister of some sort  but his actual faith is left pretty vague  \\ni cant even say for certain that he was supposed to be a christian  \\nall we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about premarital sex  \\nthe film drops the science ball at the very end  when ellie appears to assert that there are some things even scientists must take on faith  \\nin a day and age when the theory of evolution is denounced by the religion right as an atheist  religious  doctrine  this is exactly the wrong message to send  \\nin a movie dealing with issues of science and faith  the last thing you want your scientist character to do is abandon the principle of scientific skepticism  \\nwhat ellie should have said was   you shouldnt believe me  \\nnot without evidence  and i dont have the evidence  \\ni know what happened but you shouldnt take my word alone   \\nthat is the voice of science speaking  \\nthe character of david drumlin is another problem with this film  \\nhis attitudes toward pure research project seem out of place for a person in his position  \\nalso  his profession of  faith  before the selection committee is so nakedly and transparently insincere that only a pack of idiots should have fallen for it  \\nthe last big problem is with the use of real personalities in various roles  \\nthe media figures  such as bernard shaw and jay leno arent so bad  in as much as their participation was voluntary  \\nthe use of bill clinton  however  should give anyone pause  \\nfirst of all  lifting the image of a sitting head of state and inserting him into a fictional story line  thus using his words outside of the context in which they were spoken  is just plain creepy  \\nalso  using the real president places this film between  and   forever dating it  \\npeople watching this film in the future will say   hey  this never took place during clintons term   \\nthis bit of unreality will jar people out of their suspension of disbelief  \\nalso  the level of technology portrayed in the film is too advanced to take place before the first decade of the next century  \\nbetter to have had a fictitious president played by an actor or no president at all  \\nthe film does raise an interesting question  although it never develops it in a satisfying way  \\nif we were picking an emissary to send to an alien culture  would an atheist be automatically disqualified just because ninety percent of the population of the world professes a belief in god  or at least some form of supernatural creator  \\npersonally  i would hope not  since religion is basically an opinion  a form of ideology  \\ni would not want any form of ideological test for such an import task  \\n',\n",

that he cant make a film without flowing blood and foul creatures  \\nthe way i see it  this is the films crucial failure  \\nit is impossible for cronenbergto create a beautiful world where time

that of  manhattan   my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time  \\nwoody allens films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair  so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit handinhand   manhattan  really is one of the bestlooking films ive ever seen  beautiful black and white photography of the citys best areas  etc    a fan cant help but feel visibly moved  \\nthe film opens up  with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds  and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack  but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky  with the word  help  being spelled with an airplane  \\nbeethovens th blasts on the soundtrack  \\nthe city seems to stop to take notice of this moment  and its all rather lovely to look at  \\nand then we cut to a film crew  shooting this as the films hilariously banal key moment in the film  where the lead actress in the film  melanie griffith  looking as buxom and beautiful as ever  has to realize somethings wrong with her life or whatever  \\nits a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film  with the great opening shots or without  and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again  a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works  though  for the record  last years  deconstructing harry  came awfully close   \\nwhat the hell has happened to him  \\nthe man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny  but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas  \\n  bullets over broadway   though wonderful  relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off  \\n  mighty aphrodite  is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story  \\n  everyone says i love you  was more of a great idea than a great film  \\neven  deconstructing harry  is admittingly cheap in a way  even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films  \\nif anything  the reception of  celebrity  by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time  its not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is  its him  \\n  celebrity  is  yes  a good film  but its only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film  \\ninstead of creating the great woody allen world  hes created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about  \\nand hes fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities  so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections  \\nits like  la dolce vita  without the accuracy  the right amount of wit  and the correct personal crisis  \\nwoody  becoming more insecure in his old age  choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities  and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny  and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead  \\nmuch has been said about his performance  dead on but irritating  makes one yearn for the real thing  blah blah blah  but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branaghs performance  though featuring some of the same mannerisms  stuttering  whining  lots o hand gestures   is hardly a wartsandall impersonation  \\nbranagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm  which actually allows for his characters flaws to be more apparent  \\nwoodys a flawed guy  and we know it  but we love him anyway  because hes really funny and really witty and really intelligent  \\nbranaghs allen is a bit more flatout bad  but with the same charm so that  yes  we like him  but were still not sure if hes really a good person or not  \\nhis character  lee simon  is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie  hits on extra actress winona ryder  then goes off to interview griffith  who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her  and she denies him    sorta  \\nwe then learn  through flashbacks  that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a midlife crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion  \\nhe has since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist of sorts  covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate  so that he can meet them  and maybe sell his script  a bank robbery movie  but with a deep personal crisis    \\nas such  he has divorced his wife of several years  allen regular judy davis   and continues on a quest for sexual happiness  boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film  \\nafter griffith comes his escapades with a model  charlize theron  who is  polymorphously perverse   glad to see allen is using new jokes  ha ha   who takes him for a wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of  la dolce vita   \\nfollowing are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen  a relationship that almost assures him success  and his continued escapades with ryder  whom he fancies most of all  \\nhis story is juxtaposed with that of davis  who flips out  but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome  friendly tv exec  joe mantegna  who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status  \\nwhile lee is fumbling about  selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness  davis becomes happy   ive become the kind of woman ive always hated    and \\nim loving it    \\nwithout doing a thing  \\nthe result is a film of highs and mediums  \\nthe mediums are what take up most of the film  with sitations and scenes which dont exactly work but you cant help but pat allen on the back for trying  \\nbut other places are really great scenes  \\nthe opening  \\nthe sequence with theron  which is so good that i wished it hadnt ended  \\na banana scene with bebe neuwirth  droll as ever   \\nand  perhaps the best sequence  a romp with hotashell teen idol  brandon darrow  played by none other than leo dicaprio  who is so undicaprioesque that if any of this fans could sit through this film  theyd never look at him the same way  \\nhe ignites the screen with intensity  and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical  and totally heartbreaking for lee  who comes to him to talk about his script that he has read  and finds himself on a wild allday ride with him  \\nthey go to atlantic city to watch a fight  they gamble  and they wind up in his hotel room  where darrow gets it on with his flame  gretchen mol  and he lends him one of the leftover groupies  \\nallens writing in these scenes are so good that just for them  id almost recommend the film  \\nalmost  \\nbut what i really liked about this film is despite the fact that its a mess  despite the fact that what this film really needs is a good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself  its still a smart and insightful film  \\nthough some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced  some seem too cartoonish  even for this environment   allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities  as it may seem to be  if it were  itd be extremely outoftouch   but about those who want to be celebrities  and how they equate celebrityhood with happiness  \\nwe never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see if theyre really happy  they may appear to be on the surface      but we do get close enough to lee and davis character  \\nlee is obsessed with the phenomenon  while davis takes is at arms length  and never gets too involved in what it is  and soon becomes one herself  \\nbesides  its witty  and it does have the one thing that no other film has but allens  that great woody allen feel  \\nit may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject  and yes  as a part of woody allens oeuvre  its merely a blip  no  annie hall  but its no  shadows and fog  either   but it goes to prove that no one can make a film like him  and only he and maybe godard could possibly take a totally horrible metaphor  like the one in the beginning  and make it work not once but twice

more easily is the fact that each soldier  no matter what his rank or importance  is a real fleshandblood person and not just a number  \\n  saving private ryan  is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect  especially in its unapologetic  realistic delivery  \\nit proves theres a huge difference between battling and killing  \\nthe film opens with one of the most graphic  disturbing scenes in recent memory  \\nits world war ii  dday to be exact  and the u  s  military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them  \\nspielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality  \\ninstead of positioned cameras  the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared  \\nthere is no sense of stability  but of constant  anxious  and confusing motion  giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle  and just a vulnerable as the poor troops  \\n  poor  is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are  \\nthere is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters  \\nwe dont get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles  but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding  \\nthe nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated  but as people that must be destroyed because theyre there  \\nin the movies  the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch  but in reality that wouldnt happen  \\nthe men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies  \\nthey are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the wellsecured germans who can actually see who  what  and where theyre shooting  unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off  \\nperhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are  but that seems to be part of the theme  \\nthe film seems to rely on the audiences sense of patriotism  that the american military is  right  and good and that the nazis are  inherently evil   \\nthe battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold  a whole foot progression   and begin to inflict some damage  \\ni have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up  i couldnt help but feel some sense of joy and relief  \\nto triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure  but theres nothing cliche about the graphic  detailed  atmosphere here because it really happened  \\none of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is  and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting  \\nthe plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet  \\ntom hanks stars as captain miller  a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon  \\nhes never obsessive or any such generic  cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this  \\nhe doesnt want to be there any more than his men  but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out  \\nthe mission the film is concerned with is  as the title states  saving private ryan  \\nthrough a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker  it is brought to a generals attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of eachs death simultaneously  \\nwhen they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe  they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother  \\nits easy to sympathize with this situation  after all  no one should have to lose all their children at once  \\nbut finding one man in this war is  as miller puts it   like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles   \\nthe saving of private ryan isnt just a dramatic device  but a thematic one  \\nhis salvation represents the sense of innocence the country  the world even  was trying to convince itself it still had  \\nwhen millers company hears of the mission  they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead  but miller isnt so quick to shrug it off  \\nhe knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope  and now he has the opportunity to make someones sense of hope a reality  \\nthe mission to find ryan gives millers group a destination  but not direction  \\nalong the way many things happen to them  both good and bad  \\na few battles are fought  not to be major accomplishments for the war  but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice  \\nthe act of killing itself becomes one of the films major philosophical metaphors  \\nthe soldiers dont mind killing other soldiers in blind battle  but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go  they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses  \\nunfortunately  death is a fact of war  and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters  but here spielberg doesnt want us to think these men are invincible  \\nin fact  only a small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man  and the performances are good enough to make this method work  \\nalthough the characters are somewhat typical  the actors maintain control over the material at all time  \\nwhether theyre arguing with each other  telling stories of back home  or fighting the germans  they never go overboard and always seem believable  \\nsure  theres a zinger here and there  but war doesnt change the fact boys will be boys  \\nif and when one dies we too can feel the loss  even though we hardly knew them  \\nthe final act brings the story full circle with another tremendous  violent battle sequence  \\nprivate ryan has been found  but facing four to one odds  can the americans defeat the germans and keep ryan alive  \\nthats not a premise for thrills  its symbolic of everything the film has worked for  \\nit would be wrong to say the film has either a happy or sad ending  it ends the way it must end  \\ni remember reading a  calvin  hobbes  comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like   dad  how do armies of men killing each other solve problems   \\n  saving private ryan  is the adult version of that question  \\n',\n",

       " 'i was pleasantly surprised by this film  \\nwith a budget topping  million  i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth centurys greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see  \\nhow much could you dress up the sets  \\nhow many models and computer effects could you use  \\nhow much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks  \\noh  if ive just given away part of the plot for you  go back to school  \\nafter having viewed titanic  however  i found it to be a wellpaced  welldesigned  and overall wellmade movie  \\nthere have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic  but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best ive seen  \\ntitanic tells its story in two time periods  \\nit starts out in the present  when ocean explorer brock lovett  bill paxton  and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic  searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship  \\nwhat they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace  which is broadcast on the news  \\nthe woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett  who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas  \\nthere she tells her story to lovett and his team  \\nin   rose dewitt bukater  kate winslett   a young lady belonging to societys upper class  boards the titanic for the ships first atlantic crossing  from southampton  england to new york  \\nshe is engaged to cal hockley  billy zane   an heir to old money  and a snob in every sense of the word  \\non board  rose feels the stifling trappings of highsocietys expectations  and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanics stern  but is saved from her selfproclaimed fate by jack dawson  leonardo dicaprio   a passenger in thirdclass   steerage   as its referred to   who talks her out of jumping  \\nalthough for rose the attraction is not immediate  a love affair soon develops between the two  which endangers roses social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal  \\nthe story sounds very simple  and perhaps even unexciting  but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron  a good movie comes through  \\ndicaprio is marvelous as the young  but worldlywise jack  playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors  \\nhis is a character that is immediately likable  as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations  \\ngirls are going to swoon over him  \\nwinslet also proves herself a good actress  delivering her lines convincingly  and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable  \\nthe only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her characters upbringing  \\nsimply by judgment of her gait  i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an uppercrust debutante  \\nrather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess  she sometimes looks positively clumsy  and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting  \\nbilly zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal  since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him  \\nhis features are such that even when he smiles  theres something mistrustful about him  and when he scowls  he is evil incarnate  \\nhes something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher  but a cheaper model  \\nlike dicaprio and winslet  zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well  \\nbacking up zane is david warner as lovejoy  cals personal assistant  or  man  as they said at the turn of the century   \\nno matter who else is in the cast  you can always count on a good performance by warner  who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match  \\nadditionally  there are a number of smaller fictional and nonfictional roles thrown in for color  such as kathy bates as  the unsinkable  molly brown  danny nucci as jacks friend fabrizio de rossi  eric braeden as john jacob astor  and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie  \\nnice to see dr  bombay getting work  \\nalso scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die  \\nthis by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic  but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ships crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the firstclass passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else  \\nin this way  titanic possesses a depth not usually found in action pictures  \\nyou dont just get a love story with a tragedy as a backdrop  but a very real account of class struggle as well  \\nas i mentioned before  the budget for this film was tremendous  and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects  \\nthe interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail  and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic  \\nwith regard to the exteriors  i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale  \\ncameron actually built a scale model of the titanic in a water tank  but only had room for   and therefore had to computergenerate the remaining  feet  \\ncouldve fooled me and everyone else in the theater  as the splicing is seamless  \\nalso of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning  \\nwe are told of where the iceberg struck the ship  how the flooding occurred  the way the ship sank  and why it did so in that manner  \\nthese technical details serve as a guide for later on when the action starts happening  and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction  in addition to the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem and confusion  \\nin all  james camerons titanic is a good blend of love story  history  and action  \\nthe fact that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewers attention is held alternately by those three main elements  from the movies intriguing beginning to its satisfactory ending  \\nin box office receipts  titanic the movie will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship  \\n',\n",

reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix  \\nwhile it does share some characteristics with both films  particularly the first forty minutes  which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs   the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm  \\nthe buzz around this project is that firsttime feature film director tarsem singh  who won many awards for his video of r  e  m  s  losing my religion   wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story  and a good portion of this film supports that theory  \\ndespite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments  the cell does feature some remarkable imagery  \\nall of the sequences where we delve into someones mind are incredibly beautiful  including the dank mind of stargher  whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h  r  giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video   proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe  \\nthe first sequence that takes place in starghers mind is by far the best  featuring one of the most ingenious traps ive ever seen in a film  involving a horse  which no one seeing this film will probably forget   a zoolike display of starghers victims which are animated like marionettes  and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room  \\nif the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant  but alas  the sequences only become more silly as they go along  despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film   \\nthe cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images  but at least vincent donofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance  magnified by ten  thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed   \\nin my opinion  donofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film  but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful  i  e   \\nthe newton

and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him  \\ndetractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film  as it contains heavy doses of both  \\nbesides the nipple ring removal i mention above  there is also starghers penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs  prior to his catatonia and capture  which will have audiences recoiling  \\na sequence where catherine enters starghers mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting  \\none moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spitlike device  \\nas a narrative film  the cell is sorely lacking  \\nas a collection of images though  the cell is extremely well done  \\nalthough the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half  singh has done what he supposedly set out to do  make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together  \\nunfortunately  a wellwritten script should have been considered too  because without it the cell just seems like any other music video

not heard much about francis bacon that i didnt read prior to the film  but what i learned was this  he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the s and s  drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like  \\nhe was one of the first to really come out of the closet  and in interviews  he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty  \\nas played by great shakesperean

creating bacons world of friends  like  high art   this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood   the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant  \\nbacon is haughty and bizarre  george is simple and doesnt understand bacon in the least  especially not his paintings  \\nwhile watching this  thats basically all i thought was there  \\nthe film has a hypnotic feel  free of any restraints of form  and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about  \\nonce the film is over  its easier to piece it together  \\ni kept on thinking about this film  wondering what the point to all of it was  \\nsomeone doesnt merely make a film of all style and no substance at all  and if they do  they do it by accident  but still allow some substance to creep in  \\nthinking about it  i remembered how the two fed off of eachother  \\ni thought about how bacon was a masochist  in love with cruelty  in one scene  he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight  and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxers head splashes across his face  in another scene  he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisensteins  battleship potemkin    and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain  \\nhe drove him over the edge  and for him that was love  even if it wasnt for george  \\ni guess that explains the title  \\na bit  \\nthats great and all  but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning  \\ni wish it hadnt reduced itself to making some point about humanity  about how love is the most selfish thing in the world  and it is  if you look at it a certain way   \\nor maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one mans twisted pysche  \\nits almost always best to obtain insights from looking at

stick in the mind forever  \\nand with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi  it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs  \\ni just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit

hilarious performance and gets into his character very well  with some classic lines  \\nlinda fiorentino is just perfect for her role and makes us believe that she really is who she is  \\nof course

give it all he could  \\nben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as the story  \\nthe movies only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow parts to go along with it  \\nhowever the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members  dogma stands as a new classic and i think i can safely compare it to clerks  \\nwhile being funny at times  in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with but cant deny it  \\ndogma will offend people

that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirtyyear career to gain u  s  distribution  thanks to first run features  \\nalthough unfamiliar with mehrjuis previous directing efforts  perhaps the reason for this is that  while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country  the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers  \\nset in modernday iran   leila  begins on the birthday of the title character  leila hatami   after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband  reza  ali mosaffa   \\nas leila and reza set off to visit his parents  and then hers  where a birthday celebration has been planned  things seem rosy for the couple on the outside  but for leila  life isnt quite as sweet  \\nearlier  on that very same day  leila had gone to see her physician  and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child  \\nwhen all of the conditions are ruled out  and leila passes up the possibility of adoption  reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her  and doesnt care at all about having children  \\nnonetheless  leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby  which is the societal norm  and her selfesteem is not helped at all by her domineering motherinlaw  jamileh sheikhi   whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news  reza is her only son   \\nbluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and  in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition  she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with  \\nleila hesitantly agrees  and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens inadequacies  reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like  even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesnt give her full blessing  \\nthere are no easy answers to be found within  leila   a film that thoughtfully examines the central characters unfortunate plight  as well as the inner workings of leila herself  told through matteroffact narration  \\nalmost completely taken over by her own shame  she has no option but to agree to her forceful motherinlaws requests  even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman  \\nmaybe because  leila  is from iran  the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences  since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence  \\nleila  however  is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily  but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy  no matter what the circumstances  \\none of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza  who married only three months after their first meeting  but obviously love each other very deeply  \\nit is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful  and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible  \\nalthough seemingly unimportant at first glance  an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing  nearly uncontrollably  actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half  as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another  \\nditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday  and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her  \\nthese  small  moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn  outraging sequences in the latter half  in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road  and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman  \\nleft there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage  foolishly unbeknownst to reza  leila prays each time that the date will not go well  so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer  \\nrefusing to stay over at her parents house  the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman  and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency  leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart  as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below  \\ndespite her initial agreement to such a thing  leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza  whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him  \\nsure  the whole second marriage was his mothers idea  but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children  then he could have still easily backed out  couldnt he  \\nin the pivotal role of leila  who appears in every scene  leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable  injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength  unavoidable vulnerability  and utter despair  \\nunlike most american films  in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences  hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words  \\nevery bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa  as reza  a man who  i believe  does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife  but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else  \\nfor all of its strong aspects   leila  isnt a perfect film  \\non a technical level  i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed  \\nand concerning the plot developments  the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before  \\nmehrjuis decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice  particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful motherinlaw  played memorably by jamileh sheikhi  \\ndespite these minor missteps   leila  is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may  release at new yorks cinema village  and then on may  in la  \\nthe thoughtprovoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales  and when the climax arrives  leilas selfworth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation  to which there is no return  \\nits difficult to not consider how leilas culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided  had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila  the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme  was going through  \\n',\n",

\\nwhat is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thoughtprovoking  \\nkeanu reeves plays a computer

existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines  \\nthe groups leader  morpheus  laurence fishburne   has chosen neo because he believes neo is  the one  who is destined to lead the

presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun  \\nwhat is reality  \\nwhat is a sham  \\nthe film turns our very perception of life on its side  \\nmore than once  we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality  or live a life of relative bliss  oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings  \\nas viewers  this is intriguing enough  so imagine what it would be like for neo  \\nand who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves  \\nreeves  whom ive never really cared for as an actor  is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness  and little subtlety  \\nhe was good in speed  for example  but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds  \\nneo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely  so much of my expectation was happily for naught  \\nin a couple of places  the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature  and this is a heavy credit to writersdirectors andy and larry wachowski  \\ni mean  since bill and teds excellent adventure  what movie could you say really  utilized  keanu reeves  \\nmore interesting than reeves is fishburne  whos morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions  and convincingly so  \\nvery surprising for a scifi movie  \\nfishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout  as if he always knows what to expect  \\nthis helps to further the aura of his characters proficiency and extensive knowledge  \\nhugo weaving as agent smith  one of the artificial intelligences antiintruder programs  is also good playing his deadpan  nononsense  kick ass role  which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time  \\nunfortunately  when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row  the nature of his characters speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive  \\ncarrieanne moss plays trinity  morpheuss number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo  \\nalthough her character is somewhat inconsistent  moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isnt in the picture  \\nthere were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects  \\nmany methods of imagery are employed  from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics  \\nof special note is the use of the  freeze and turn  effect where the entire scene is frozen  turned  then continued from a new angle  \\nthis is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semicircle  with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends  \\nthe motion cameras film the action  and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once  \\nplace each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second  \\npretty slick  \\nthe matrix drips with style  \\nfrom the clothing to the music to the action  were watching an exaggerated

with an automatic weapon  much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion  \\ntheres also the element of the japanese action cartoon  called anime by aficionados   especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects  \\ncombined  its really like no liveaction film i have ever seen  \\nthe film is not without its faults  \\nsome of the scenes and ideas are  borrowed  a little too liberally from other films  and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing  \\nsome of the lines are also pretty bad  in one instance  a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying  and it wasnt meant to be a joke  \\nhowever  these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action scifi

love with me  \\nnow  onto more serious stuff  and with this film  i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way   \\nwild things has singlehandedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa  \\nim not saying that in a bad way  but when you see this film  you may be shocked by what you see  \\nhowever  perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the films charming cast and tricky plot  that they let the film slide with an r rating  \\nbeing mormon  im bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film  \\ntrouble is  i have already seen it  \\nand i like it  \\nwild things is a film noir of the s  filled with s sensibilities  and yet breaking the rules and modernday taboos of s culture  \\nthe style in which it is filmed is rich in color  \\nthe actors are all gorgeous people  seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film  \\nsure  its all too good to be true  but aint it fun to watch  \\nwhen movies like this come along  sort of a better version of basic instinct  there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it  \\nthere will be people who dont want to admit liking what they see  but i tell you  most anyone who sees this will like it  \\nwild things begins at blue bay high school  the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into  \\nits almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance  totally based on looks alone   \\nof course  there are those select few who may look slightly ugly  but compared to the average person  they are gorgeous  \\nimmediately  the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time  \\nwe can turn off our brains  right  \\nwrong  \\nwhile you may be expecting one thing to happen  it certainly doesnt turn out that way  \\nthe film begins in a classroom  with nearly all the main characters present  \\ntheres sam lombardo  matt dillon   a counselor for the students  \\nhes heading the class discussion  \\ntheres also kelly van ryan  denise richards   a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam  \\nteaching the class  however  are two policemen  ray duquette  kevin bacon  and gloria perez  daphne rubinvega   who want to talk about sex    \\n  cheers  crimes  boos    \\n  what is a sex crime   \\nray asks  \\n  not gettin any   \\none student responds  \\nthis pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch  \\nhowever  upon hearing this  one student  suzie toller  neve campbell   stands up and leaves the room  commenting that they can both kiss part of her body  \\nand so  wild things sets into motion  \\nquickly  kelly begins hitting on sam  but sam doesnt want anything to do with her advances  \\nkelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him  \\nshe even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep  \\nsurprisingly  thats really all i can tell you about the plot  \\nany more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists  \\nand whats more  these plot twists are actually unpredictable  \\ngoing along the way of scream  wild things maintains that films surprises  and then adds even more to them  \\nthere are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen  \\nand even though you think you may get tired of them  the surprises are so genuine that its rather pleasing  \\ngoing back over them in my mind  nearly all of them work  though some stretch the boundaries of belief  \\nthankfully  the convoluted plot doesnt give us much time to think about each one  pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off  \\nas for the critics who complain that the film is trashywell  it is  \\nthis is pretty much just one trashy film  \\nhowever  it is the kind of trashy that isnt hard to watch  \\nits good trash  in a sense  \\none  the screenplay knows that its not to be taken seriously  and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story  \\nthis varies everywhere from kellys mother  theresa russell   who is more of a caricature of rich people  all the way to an ambulancechasing lawyer  bill murray   who wears a neckbrace to cover an insurance scam he is running  \\nbill murray also provides the best character in the film  and most of the genuine laughs  \\nand two  the sex is more than gratuitous  although not unwelcomed  \\nwild things is supposed to have sex in it  what film with that title wouldnt    and this movie breaks the boundaries  \\ninstead of having heterosexual sex scenes  it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell  dont worry    \\nits not as graphic as you might think   \\nthe heterosexual scenes are quite graphic  but the surprise shocker is kevin bacons fullfrontal nude scene  \\nits very brief  so if you blink  you may miss  ahem  it  \\nand  for as long as i can remember  i dont think i have seen an rrated film show an erect one before  its not completely  but judging from the audiences reaction  it was more than they expected too   \\nalso  during one scene late in the film  there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillons characters  but nothing came of it  makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating  or if the actors refused to do it   \\nwhat first made me want to see wild things was its cast  \\nneve campbell  of course  has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released  \\nhere  however  she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead  \\nthe closest role to this was her performance in the craft  though even in that she was a nice girl   \\ncampbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent  \\nyou can tell she will be around for a long time  \\ndenise richards will also be around for a long time  although she may be limited to the roles without much range  \\nhere  she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff  yet effective  performance in starship troopers  \\nhopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability  \\nand then there is daphne rubinvega  a newcomer to the movies  \\nshe gives a very good performance  although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half  \\ntowards the end she does get a bigger part  \\non the male side  matt dillon is probably the best  giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist  \\nkevin bacon has a slightly wooden character  but he makes the most of it  \\nyou must have admiration  though  for what he did on screen  \\nand judging from many of the womens reactions in the theater to that shot  they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon  yeah  right   \\nand then there is bill murray  \\nhis performance is the comic relief  and he nearly steals the film  \\nas a whole  the entire cast works wondrously together  and they seem at home  even when doing the menage a troi  \\ndirector john mcnaughton  who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry  portrait of a serial killer  has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works  \\nhis direction is smooth and stylish  \\nthe visuals are striking  filled with rich colors  and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air  \\nhowever  he seems more at home when the actors arent talking  \\nhis flyby shots of the swampy areas are brilliant  and his photography of denise richards climbing out of the pool is a highlight  \\nthe cinematography is gorgeous in its details  its not often that you see a film like this  and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures  \\nthen  there is the music  \\nthis was probably the most obvious thing to me  as it set the perfect mood for the film  \\nits hard to describe in words  so just see the film and listen to it  \\nits wonderfully composed and presented  \\nand be sure to stick around during the closing credits  \\nmcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use  while most comedies use it for outtakes   \\nhe has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events  \\nsome may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot  but its an entertaining way to finish the film  \\nplus  there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun  \\nwild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality  nudity  language and violence  \\nagain  the nudity is rather unnecessary  but lets face itpeople want to see it  \\nso why not give it to them  \\nneve campbell  admirably  has a nonudity clause in her contract  and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off  way to go  neve    \\nthe sex scenes are graphic  especially the first one we see  between the mother and one of her deck hands  \\none almost wonders how they got away with the r rating  \\nthe language is quite harsh too  ranging from sexual innuendo to your average  everyday profanity  \\nand i cant stress it enough  dont allow kids under  to see this film  \\nthe target age for the movie is the  range  and thats who should see it  \\nits definitely not for those under   \\ndid i mention that this film is rated r  however  for those that do get a chance to watch it  you will probably more likely be pleased  and may even take friends to see it the next time  \\n',\n",

breakup scene between will and skylar  will and seans first meeting  a bar scene between sean and lambeau  and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesnt regret meeting his first wife  who would later suffer a slow  painful death  and leave him lonely and slightly bitter  \\nhowever  the main flaw of the film is theres too much of everything  and not enough of it either  \\nthe film tries for deeper relations between the characters  but theyre sometimes either overwritten or underwritten  \\ntake for example the relationship between sean and will  the film gets an interesting fatherson as well as doctorpatient relationship going with out any problems  but when it tries to show them as equals  it falls on its face  \\nwe hear how they went to the same town  and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times  \\nbut this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do  \\nalso  wills relationship with his best friend  chuckie  affleck   has a nice climax  but not enough rising action  \\nwe see them joking around  but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them  it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one  \\ntheir relationship never goes beyond  just best friends   and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more    human  \\nmaybe it was just me  \\nand it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau  but that  again  is underwritten  \\nand  of course  as in most films like this  the girlboy relationship is pretty underwritten  \\nwe never understand what they see in each other  so when skylar confesses that she loves him  it seems more like its there for plot details that anything else  \\nminnie driver is interesting  though  and breathes life into her character  \\nthe writing is a bit at fault here  but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness  \\nsure  it feels overstuffed  but its extremely enjoyable  \\nthe dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh  and seems extremely human  \\ni think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue  which is amazing  \\nwhile this is probably director gus van sants most conservative film  youd hardly know its the same director of  to die for   the only van sant film ive seen  really   its still a pretty remarkable film  albeit a tad overrated  whats this  best picture  deal    \\nand if a film

compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen  \\nfor all  minutes  director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro  in the title role  have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic  sad  and horrifying  \\nhistorically  raging bull is said to be mostly accurately  with the lions share of the details culled from la mottas own autobiography  which was cowritten with joseph carter and peter savage   \\nhowever  although la motta is credited as the movies  consultant   he was reportedly unhappy with the final result  because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth  insensitive lout  \\nthe la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base  bestial impulses  paranoia  jealousy  and blind rage  \\nsex and violence are inextricably linked  \\nthe title is apt  la motta is a raging bull  \\nin the ring  he is a terror  not just beating his opponents  but destroying them  \\noutside of it  he is no less vicious or more easily controlled  \\nthe two people who spar with him on lifes canvas are his wife  vicki  cathy moriarty   and his brothermanager  joey  joe pesci   \\nthese are the two who mean the most to jake  and who  as a result of his inability to trust himself or others  he loses  \\nhe beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity  and  when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him  his lets loose with an explosion of violence  \\nraging bull opens in  when la motta  an upandcoming fighter  is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class  \\nover the years  he wins several key bouts  including one against his archrival  sugar ray robinson  johnny barnes   but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match  \\nmeanwhile  away from the ring  la motta falls in love with year old vicki  who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife  \\nvicki becomes jakes greatest prize  a wife  in his view  is not a companion  but a possession  and the source of his most extreme pain  \\nhis own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him  \\nhence  he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else  perhaps even his brother  \\n  this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere   are you f   king my wife      \\nin the late s  la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight  but with one huge condition  he must take a fall  \\nhe does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing  \\ntwo years later  he wins the championship  only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray  \\nby the late s and early s  when the film ends  jake has become a pathetic figure  a broke  overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor  has lost his wife and children  and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine  \\nraging bull is the other side of rocky  \\nsylvester stallones tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in   \\nit won the  best picture oscar  and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production  \\nbut  where rocky romanticizes boxing  raging bull takes a cold  unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring  \\nwhile scorseses primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man  he never backs away from showing the seedy  ugly underside of a sport where gambling  greed  and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working  \\nrocky shows boxing at its noblest  raging bull shows it at its most diseased  \\ntheres little i can say here that hasnt already said about de niros performance  \\nin a career that has included many fine roles  this is his most outstanding  \\nthe level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering  \\nand  although theres a lot of travis bickle  de niros character in taxi driver  in la motta  scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that  if we never fully sympathize with him  at least we understand the forces that drive him  \\nthis is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting  \\nas the younger jake  de niro is trim and fit  \\nas the fat  older man  de niro gained  pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form  \\nhow many actors would go that far  \\nthe best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance  \\ncathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work  although neither won   \\ntheir portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niros  \\npesci  who has basically recreated the same personality in two other scorsese films  goodfellas and casino   presents joey as a slightly more intelligent version of his brother  \\nthe misogyny and violence are still there  only better concealed  \\nbut  when joey snaps  as he does in one scene where he pounds on a mobster  frank vincent   its startling to behold  \\nmoriarty  on the other hand  must play the temptress with virginal qualities  the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake  \\nlater  shes called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear  \\nscorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in blackandwhite  a few  home movie  segments are in color   \\nthe choice is perfect for the movie  giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a blackandwhite approach is almost unheard of  \\n  one important recent exception  schindlers list  eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did   \\nin blackandwhite  especially considering scorseses choice of shots and use of slow motion   the violence is stark and disturbing  \\ntheres no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas  \\nduring fight sequences  the director also uses a number of pointofview shots designed to show the world  however briefly  from la mottas perspective  \\nscorsese could have chosen to end the film with la mottas loss to sugar ray  where he surrendered his middleweight crown  \\nafter that  his career was all downhill  \\nyet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment  stretching more than a decade into la mottas future  \\nthe reason is obvious  scorsese isnt as interested in boxing as he is in the character  \\nfollowing his retirement  la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever  but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies  \\nwe see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self  \\nwho cannot feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brandos speech from on the waterfront  \\n   i coulda been a contenda    \\nperhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the s  \\nand  if not  its certainly perilously close to the zenith  \\n',\n",
       " 'much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of  lolita   made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made  over its use of pedophilia  and as such  its important to address it straightforwardly  before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed  as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years  lying around in vaults san a distributor  and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit  \\nwhen seeing this film  after all the hoopla  keeping in mind that there are people  namely me  who are fans of the novel  who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation    well  \\nyou just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution  \\nwhats even worse is that seeing this  lolita   especially the first time and if youre familiar with anything  lolita   is admittingly very anticlimactic  \\nthis is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film  ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it  its really quite a film  perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne  although  really  look at its competition   flashdance    fatal attraction   and  indecent proposal    at least besides  jacobs ladder   \\nive seen this  lolita  twice  the first time  i wasnt so blown away  \\nit seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting  \\nthe second time  not really thinking about how ive waited for what seems like forever to see it and how im seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel and not a giant movie theatre  it really affected me emotionally  \\nthe story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one  which is why its such a good novel  and why this is such a good film  \\nthe story of a pedophile obsessed with a young year old girl named dolores a  k  a  lolita is great because its not trash for the perverted but because its about human obsession with things that are out of ones reach  \\nits protagonist  the comicallynamed humbert humbert  is not your average pedophile  but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies  \\nthe character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology  something that will destroy us but that we cant live without  \\nthese ideas are all worked into this film nicely  but done in a way that is not heavyhanded at all  but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating  \\nthe focus of this film  and the reason for making it  it seems  was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images  and scenes which are blatantly overstylized  \\nthe tone of the book is a comical one  but its also a tragic one  and humbert  telling the story from his perspective  blows every single thing out of perspective  \\nhumbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires  and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed  \\nwe get a sense that perhaps its by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed  \\nhe weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original yearold love  and allows himself to embody her as lolita  \\nhe lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions  and by the end  he has nothing but overlydramatic feelings for her  \\nthe story recognizes the extreme of this  almost out of a test  seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert  and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author  vladimir nabokov  wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions  and perhaps bring them to peace  \\nthe weirdest thing about this film is that by the end  when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey  we can easily sympathize and even identify with him  \\nthe opening and final images of the film are the same  and who hasnt done a similar action  that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us  \\nthis is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen  the first time being filmed in  shock    by stanley kubrick  who couldnt possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do  but did the next best thing  he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general  \\nin that film  he used the traps of society as benefits  \\nthe studio demanded the final scene  that of a heinous murder  come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile    and \\nwhen you see it  it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession  \\nthe censors wouldnt allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the  um  relationship between humbert and lolita  so kubrick decided to play it as comedy  but still allow the tragedy to seep through  \\nlooking at these two versions  especially after reading the novel  and we all know that when weve read a novel and see a film adaptation  we are bound to be angered by any size differences   its really impossible to compare them  \\nthey both go for different things  and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was  \\nand although its true that several scenes are similar  and are thus up for comparison  overall its unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse  \\ni have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is  and i wont say that here  \\nhowever  this film is pretty amazing  mostly because hey  i loved the book  and this film nearly reminded me of it  \\nit doesnt have nearly as much wit  a couple comical scenes  and even a lot of good chuckles  but just not totally witty   but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had  \\nsome of that is in the casting of the two leads  \\njeremy irons  with his deep  soft british voice and gentle look  is an amazing humbert  \\nhes droll in a very unique way  and  well  no one can look distraught the way he does  \\nhe brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience  \\nand when he looks at lolita with love  and she looks at him with lust  you know that hes her prisoner for as long as he lives  \\nand dominique swain  who plays the title character  is rather incredible  \\nshe pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original  wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction  bratiness  and selfcenteredness that marks the character  \\nits easy to see why she surrenders to humbert  she loves the attention  and knows that she can have her way with him at any time  \\nwhen he denies her something  she blackmails him effortlessly  a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic   and when he stands up to her  she weeps and runs away  leaving humbert to follow her  \\nthere are two other minor characters in the film  one whos a road block in the beginning  and the other whos a reappearing threat to the relationship  \\nthe former is charlotte  lolitas mother  played by melanie griffith  \\nin the book  charlotte is a monster of a woman  overbearing  constantly scolding her child  overlyreligious  and ultimately selfish  \\nand shes the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal  at least in the beginning  \\nas played by shelly winters in the original  she represented all these qualities  as played by griffith here  shes about half of them  \\nits annoying to watch a film and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first  \\nand even though griffith is not really bad  persay  shes nothing more  \\nthe other is clare quilty  the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita  and succeeds  but at a price  \\nlangella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original  \\nquilty was a comic character in the original  a threat in the form of many forms  popping in states of rambling  german  proning  and eventually drunk  \\nlangella takes the other route  allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed  and the result is a character who exists in shadows and low shots  and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending  the exact opposite of what we thought of him  \\nas you can see  most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter  stephen schiff  but just parts of a whole new look at the novel  at least cinemawise  \\nthis version is beautiful  and perpetually saddening  \\nthe camera movements are stylized  and each shot is breathtakingly rich  \\nthe acting is for the most part wonderful  and when we watch it  we really get a sense that for humbert  who is telling the story  the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita  \\nmore importantly  it takes us right up the brink of emotion  then jumps right over it  \\nby the end  with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car  following what he says is the only part of his life he doesnt regret  we feel that we all lose to something we can never have  \\n',\n",

       " 'im an avid fan of the  alien  saga  so this review is obviously a tad biased  at least i admitted it   \\nof course  that doesnt mean that im gonna be giving this a fourstar review or something  because  alien  resurrection   the fourth film in the coolashell series is not an absolutely amazing film  much like the first two were  \\nhowever  its a very good film which never fails to entertain  and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series  \\nin short  i had a good time  \\n  alien  resurrection  leaves off  years after the last one  where our heroine protagonist  ellen ripley  sigourney weaver   the science fiction genres answer to job  had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body  waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one  \\nof course  the last one wasnt very great or anything  i liked it  though not as much as the first two   and more importantly  it wasnt financially successful  a tawdry  million bucks    \\nso back we are  with ripley back as a clone  which means we get another little satirical look at cloning  not that thats a bad thing  but its becoming a cliche   \\nso shes cloned aboard an even more futuristiclooking ship called  the auriga  by some doctors  including the necessary bad government guy  dr  wren  played by j  e  freeman  as well as the littleseen dr  gediman  played by none other than brad douriff   mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her  \\nonce you get past the fact that you cant figure out where they got her blood  although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one   the films okay  \\nalso on board are a band of mercenary pirates  including michael wincott  ron perlman  kim flowers  raymond cruz  dominique pinon  a jeunet sytable  and    winona ryder  who plays analee call  who turns out to have a bit of a secret  i wont state it  but unless youve been shacking up with salinger for the past two years  you probably know all about it  although its nicely covered up   \\ntheres a bit of a nonsexualyetslightlyhomoerotic relationship between her and ripley  but its never really deepened enough  \\noh well  \\nwell  as you might have guessed  the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship  \\nand it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship  including some shocks  dan hedaya  for instance  whos death is comical yet sad since  well  hes dan hedaya   and the remaining people  about  or   are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth  \\nof course  the plot is all balderdash  and just an excuse for some good old  alien  brand fun  \\nthe real focus of the series seems to be on style  not really substance  although theres always a bit of it  most notably in  aliens  with the relationship between ripley and the little girl   \\nwhats interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach  \\n  alien  is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights  \\n  aliens  is a wild  tense thriller  \\n  alien   is a bleak  moody piece of seminoir  \\n  alien   is kind of like an offbeat french film  filled with lots of humor  and cool scares  \\njeanpierre jeunet  without his usual directing partner  marc caro  creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like  das boot  has  with echoes hinting at a possible threat  \\nthe chills in the film are really cool  especially with the music  which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes  theres the most tense surgery scene since  faceoff  towards the beginning   \\nand not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that  \\nthis all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others  \\nthere are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed  \\none is the aforementioned surgery scene  \\nanother one takes place between call and ripley  which is just awesome  \\nthe underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense  thrilling  and jawdropping scenes in the entire saga  with a small allusion to jeunets earlier film   delicatessen    \\nand the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool  with a lovely allusion to  goldfinger    \\nbut the best scene in the entire film  im sure im not the first to mention it  takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her  she has a an    tatooed on her arm   \\nit might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga  \\nthe screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work  as it never really deapens a lot of the characters  \\nhowever  it does make us care about most of them  so that when theres very little of them  and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow  we are pretty scared  \\nand  yeah  there are some very funny lines  ripley   who do i have to fuck to get off this boat    \\njohner   well  i can get you off  \\nbut not this ship    \\nthe acting is good all around  with standout performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner  and leland orser  the poor bastad in  seen  who performed the  lust  sin  as an anxietyridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him  \\nwinona ryder is good  but not amazing like she usually is  although she meshes well with the film   \\nof course  and as usual  sigourney weaver steals the show  \\nplaying a variation on the ripley character  less emotional  and more rude and bitter   she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable  \\nshes not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for  aliens   but shes just awesome  \\noverall  its a thrilling  entertaining film which doesnt really amaze like the first two  but is much more amazing than the third installment  \\nthe style is the best part of the film  which isnt really a bad thing  but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply  \\nbut its entertaining as hell  and its definitely fit for the  alien  series  \\n',\n",
       " 'it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship  a green ovular pin  and the birth of oscar wilde  but if one really strains  they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off  \\nwildes philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature  and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned  loosing his family and his career  \\nthe glam rock movement in the early s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise  \\nthe main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life  mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality   they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else  \\nand thats why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began  \\nits been said that todd haynes  velvet goldmine   the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement  not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it  steals a lot from  citizen kane   and thats true  \\nin the film  a british journalist in the s  arthur stuart  christian bale   is asked to go back and find out what happened to s glam rock star brian slade  a fictitious rock star  who faked his own death on stage  bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement  \\nstructurewise  this totally steals from  kane   not only from the setup  he interviews three people  and the story is a result of their flashbacks   but in other things  like the beginning  death  then newsreel   and smaller details  like the bitter exfriend in a wheelchair and the bitter exwife as a washedup lounge singer  found in a bar after hours  \\nthis is no  kane   and it really doesnt aspire to be  it doesnt attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like  kane  did  and it doesnt really uncover anything poignant about humanity  \\ninstead  it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants  \\nthe s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy  equipped with a performance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging  \\nbut the s scenes are engaging  though  not to mention addictively campy  \\nthey radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era  and a feel thats so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the thenfootage  they become not only a symbol of decadence  but of times when everything seemed so simple  \\ninstead of creating the world the way it was  haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale  the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after youve experienced it  everything else seems so mundane  \\ntheres no outside world to speak of  secluding these people inside a protective globe that will eventually crack  \\nhaynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero  curt wild  and their relationship that created  molded  and then brought down the movement  reducing everyone else who contributed to it as merely that  contributors  \\nblade  played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers  and wild  played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor  are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop  respectively  complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been onetime partners in music  but also partners in bed  \\nthrough discussions with slades exmanager cecil  michael feast   exwife mandy  toni collette  reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when with slade   and finally expartner wild  journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the era  like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity  including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality  when he opens up his first slade record  he finds a naked and green slade lying on a crimson blanket   and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene  finally resulting in leading a boring job in america  \\nhaynes demonstrates that hes quite the visual auteur  molding scenes that are like long heald breaths  such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a sladewild concert of them performing a brian eno cover   babys on fire   with scenes from a decadent drug party  and the films most wowinspiring sequence  the first concert scene of wild with his band  the ratttz  where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggyesuqe movements  including stripping naked  and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers a major talent  and another  slade  discovers his idle  \\neven the brief music videos  spoofs of bowies  have a rare visual flair thats pure camp  and which would cause ken russell to drool  \\nthe best sequence  though  may be the beginning  following the prelude  a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement and the postmovement era  \\nin it  stuart and his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death  where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be a real assasination  which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet  \\nwith brian enos famous  needle in the camels eye  playing in the background  the scene has a detached exhileration  the song doesnt seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are  \\nit has a distance thats hard to put a finger on  and it seems to represent that all this is coming to a quick and sad ending  and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show  docked in a silver frock with wings and blue hair  depressingly staring into the mirror  it comes off as a nonetooobvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film  \\nthis movies not so much about plot  but more about the way it is presented  making this one of those films which is classified as being  style over substance   a statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack  \\nhowever  for the most part  the engaging part of this film is not the story but rather the way in which haynes creates this world  by using his sets  costumes  cinematography  and especially the music to play as characters in his film  \\nthe music is especially notable  \\nthe soundtrack  which is wall to wall  consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno  trex  and roxy music  as well as covers by slades band  with vocals by thom yorke  and occasionally rhys meyers himself   and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowielike  \\nthe cast is rather impressive  but no one really walks away with the film  and no performances are extremely good  \\nalthough eddie izzard  as slades manager  who challenges slades first manager to an armwrestling match to see who gets control of his career  and michael feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly  and collette and mcgregor have their moments  rhys meyers and bale are noticably subpar  neither putting a lot of effort into their respective roles  \\nsome of it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes  \\nrhys meyers brian slade remains merely a metaphor for the glam rock era  dying when he turned into a retrogarbo  resorting to a life of salingerism  and found in the mids to be lying around  sniffing coke off the ass of a party girl  \\nin fact  no one in this film is really seen as a person  rather than just as a symbol or composite of a type who thrived during the era  \\nbales character is an especially tough sell  bitter and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood  hes not an extremely personal character  and his cliched experiences  being hounded by the record store guys for buying a record put out by a  poof   never help us communicate with him  \\nnevertheless  rhys meyers and mcgregor have the excuses that their characters are not really characters but rather the results of an era that has left them  and others  bitter  part of which helps the film work  since this is a major piece of eye candy  \\nat the prime of the movie  they at least look the role of fashionable leaders  slade with his perpetuallychanging  androgonys persona  and wild with his topless and unpredictable image  which clash and fuse into an unstable union  \\ntheir story  of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar whocares attitude crossed with camp  is engaging  without the personal background  \\nthe story of stuart  though  is a tougher sell because hes the everyman  and when you cant totally identify with the everyman  your storys in slight trouble  \\nas a cultural rock piece   velvet goldmine  is rather good  but it is merely good  \\nit never totally takes off  although it has moments where it absolutely flies  but then comes back down  \\nits really nothing more than a bunch of really great moments  surrounded by material that could really be much better  \\nthe beginning is captivating but slow  the middle is fantastic  and the ending is not only shallow but worse than that  it drags  the final half hour not only does it not bring the story to any real conclusion  it could probably stop at any point   \\nand did anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths  \\nit almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation other than to unearth the past  which is commendable but not totally so  \\nstill  it does what the oliver stone pic  the doors  didnt do right  becoming very insightful to what happened  using the visual style to hit most of the right notes of contrast between what made the era so great to those who lived during it and why after living through such an era that everything else seems halfassed  i suppose the message is   live life  but after youve lived it  what else is the point when youll be forced to live with regretful memories     \\nthe really superb achievement of this film is that during its flashbacks  it successfully creates for the audience what it must have felt like to be in that era  but with the added perk of knowing the result of all that goes down  \\n',\n",

thought titanics story was too simple and cliche  here is proof that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay  it may not have done nearly as well  \\nbut dont get me wrong    \\ni hope the film does do well  \\nits a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen  \\ni doubt most of us could have thought of this place  even in our own mind  \\nwhat dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals  \\nthe only film that surpasses it is dark city  \\nfull of rich  shocking colors  we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to  \\nbut dont do that  because youll end up going to hell  \\nwhat dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on a lake  \\nchris  christy  nielsen  robin williams  is

real problem with the film  that i could see  was that it slows down considerably during the midsection  just after we have been immersed in the visuals and before the search for annie begins  \\nby

a momentum that is almost comic  as one setback succeeds another  bottoming out when lauri stakes all their remaining money on the spin of a roulette wheel  \\nit must have been tempting to play the

a woman of thirtyeight  who has worked long and hard to win a respectable position  to be forced to accept a job as a dishwasher in a twobit restaurant  how humiliating it must be for a man nearing

prefer to ignore  \\nit engages us and touches us and resolvessurprisingly  and movinglyinto something resembling a happy ending  \\nthe only thing greater than the illluck that governs the characters

       " 'im not quite sure what to say about mars attacks   which is obviously the work of a deranged genius  \\nwhen tim burtons twisted alien invasion comedy really works  its breathtaking and hilarious in equal measure  \\nand when it doesnt work  its just dull  \\nim not even sure it works more often than it doesnt  but where it counts  that is  when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down to the business of blasting us to kingdom come  mars attacks  \\nis brilliant  \\nmars attacks  \\nis based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the s  and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summers independence day  old alien invasion flicks  disaster movies  and bigbudget special effects extravaganzas  \\nbut unlike independence day  which was a painfully middleoftheroad appeal to the hearts  minds and wallets of america  mars attacks  \\nhas a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it  \\nthe big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings  mars attacks  \\nportrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are  \\nthe title sequence is just splendid  an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation  \\nthe spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past  and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfmans thundering  theremindriven score is absolutely jawdropping  \\nits so overwhelming that  i swear to you  i had trouble breathing  \\nthe movie lays low for the next  minutes  \\nwe get a glimpse of the alien leader  resplendent in a purplesequined cape  when a television message is broadcast to the people of the world  naturally  the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming  \\nbut mostly  the first act is spent developing characters  setting up mildly comic situations  and drawing a quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton  \\nits a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens  because burtons just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars  \\nanyone who comes to mars attacks  \\nexpecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is bound to be disappointed  with few exceptions  these characters are dispatched as the film progresses  \\njack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer  rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr  strangeloves buck turgidson  glenn close brings some star power to the role of the first lady

darting this way and that  these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate  joe dantes gremlins are the closest equivalent in recent memory  but burtons little monsters are more inventive  \\nthe films raison detre are the scenes of crimes against mankind  the most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assault  easter island is turned into a bowling alley  and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans  \\nthe sheer level of mayhem is staggering  especially when the aliens make their first attack  blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons  \\nparents are urged to pay special attention to the pg rating  its earned  \\nthe special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy  and at least a couple of shots of mass destruction seem to have been engineered specifically in response to independence day  although mars attacks  \\nwas in production long before that films release  \\ncinematographer peter suschitzky  who makes the most of wynn thomass wildly imaginative production design  thomas helped define the spike lee style   actually took time off from his mars attacks  \\nregimen to shoot crash for david cronenberg  \\ncronenbergs movie will almost certainly be more somber  it wont be released in the u  s  until early next year  but mars attacks  \\nis surely a similarly elegant nightmare  \\nthis is not a nice movie  \\n  and which studio executive was duped into giving burton  million to make it   \\nby setting the films final scenes in the nearly empty  holocaustravaged america that independence day conveniently avoided  burtons invasion epic suggests that the world weve got may not be worth saving until many of the people on it are dead  \\nthe victims of his invasion are naive  greedy  or disastrously selfabsorbed  and a good thing  too  since the movies wicked charm is dependent on our ability to take this invasion partly as a wishfulfillment fantasy  \\nthe surviving cast members are the innocents and the entertainers  who triumph by determining that the alien invaders  the ultimate elitists  are actually susceptible to the kitschiest strains of american pop culture

       " '  dangerous beauty  is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa   \\nit is beautifully filmed  wonderfully acted  and certainly nothing short of entertaining  but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness  \\ndealing with themes of forbidden love  religious intolerance  subordination of women  sexual freedom  and the roles of pleasure and sin in a highcultured society  it still feels like brightly lit fluff  \\nthe director  marshall herskovitz  doesnt want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down  so he opts for a more genial  livelier  and relatively shallow interpretation  \\nthe film takes place during the renaissance  a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe  \\nat this time  venice was its own republic  and it thrived on being the central juncture of eastwest commerce  \\nthe film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice  so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived  \\nhowever  there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes  their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment  \\nthe story centers on veronica franco  catherine mccormack   a lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier  rufus sewell   the son of wealthy aristocratic parents  jeroen krabb  and joanna cassidy   \\nunfortunately  the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love  rather  it was more like a business transaction  where rich families married their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power  wealth  and ensure that outsiders couldnt get in  \\nveronica  despite her charm and good looks  is certainly an outsider  \\nafter a short love affair  marco breaks her heart with the news that he cannot marry her  \\nhowever  because she is beautiful and intelligent  veronica has a chance to enter marcos world  albeit not as his wife  \\nshe decides to become a courtesan  a class of women who were as welleducated as they were ravishing  and sold their sexuality to wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining with the elite  \\na courtesan was not a mere prostitute  they were afforded a special place in society  and they were greatly revered  respected  and often envied  \\nat one point  a character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants  \\nveronica goes through the transformation with the help of her mother  paola  jacqueline bisset   who was once a famed courtesan herself  \\nonce she enters the lifestyle  veronica finds that it suits her quite well  \\nshe is allowed to read all the books she wants  she is given the opportunity to publish her poetry  and she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet  including the awestruck marco  \\ntheir relationship develops into a playful bantering  with veronica utilizing her newfound power by constantly rejecting marcos advances  \\nin many ways  their relationship is sad because marco is married to a women he is unable to love  and veronica is consumed by multiple relationships with men she is unwilling to love  \\n  love the love  not the man   as her mother told her  \\n  dangerous beauty   which was based on a factual book by margaret rosenthal  flows along as smoothly and serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice  \\nit has multiple plot lines  including veronicas adversarial relationship with a court poet  oliver platt   her role in obtaining frances military assistance in venices battle against the turks  and even the dreaded shadow of the plague and the encroachment of the spanish inquisition  yet it is never confusing or overbearing  \\nmuch of the films success is due to the glowing performance by catherine mccormack in the lead role  \\nknown chiefly for the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibsons ire in  braveheart      mccormack shows the true gifts and inarguable talent of a leading lady  \\nshe has the kind of exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured in a courtesan  her character is intelligent  witty  and both sensual and vulnerable  all of which mccormack easily transmits with a single flash of her eyes  \\nthe rest of the roles are also filled well  including rufus sewell whose performance here and earlier this month in  dark city  have assured him a solid place in hollywood  \\nhe has the same kind of unusual good looks and charm of ray liotta  and he seems perfectly at home in period dramas  \\noliver platt plays a variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit like a second skin  although the film deals his character a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy  \\nplatt is a good actor  but hes just too hard to hate  \\njacqueline bisset proves that she is every bit as stirring as she ever was  and even fred ward turns up in a small  but moving performance as marcos uncle  \\n  dangerous beauty  is marshall herskovitzs sophomore directorial effort  after the overlooked  film  jack the bear   \\npartnered with edward zwick  herskovitz has spent most of his time as a producer on television   thirtysomething    my socalled life   and in the movies   legends of the fall    \\nhis directing style can be best described as transparent  it never gets in the way of the story  yet it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions  \\nhe could have approached the film in any number of ways  including overdosing on the sexual aspect  which he wisely avoids  \\n  dangerous beauty  contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic  but not so much that it seems exploitative  \\nherskovitz is also aided by a strong supporting crew  including the luscious photography by bojan bazelli  whose previous efforts include the highlystylized thriller  kalifornia     and abel ferraras dark scifi film  body snatchers      \\nbazelli captures the film in strong  bold colors  and be brings sixteenthcentury venice to life in wide  panoramic shots that are often enhanced with digital imagery  \\nhowever  the real details are found in the production design by norman garwood   brazil    the princess bride   and the costumes by gabriella pescucci   the age of innocence    \\nthe only problem with  dangerous beauty  is that it doesnt stick with you  \\nits a good story welltold with interesting characters  but its easy to shrug off once youve left the theater  \\nthe only sequence that has the chance to be truly indelible is veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy of the inquisition and threatened with

however  incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in  \\nthe element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr  anderson  whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious  \\nfrom the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool  mr  andersons accomplished command of the camera is without question  \\nwhile novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating  impertinent and selfcongratulatory  case in point  marc roccos unforgettable perpetualmotion helming of murder in the first   in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr  anderson  be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp  is purposeful and potent  \\nits a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmakers career  boogie nights is only his second feature film  following up his debut feature from earlier this year  hard eight  and although its somewhat derivative  his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman  while in terms of visuals hes clearly influenced by martin scorsese   at least hes borrowing from some of the best  and its entirely effective within the context of this film  \\nwhile boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective  in terms of sheer entertainment value its also rollicking good fun  with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour  \\nthe film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music  clothes  hairstyles  dance  idioms  and culture  aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges  and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent  preaidsscare period in american history where uninhibited  freewheeling lifestyles abounded  \\nwhile much of the films humour pertains to the characters obliviousness of nowoutdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society  a prime example is parttime salesman buck swopes demo of a stereo system with an eighttrack tape  and inviting a prospective customer to get freaky deaky with the music  its elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule  but of wistful reminiscence  and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous  \\na giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny  to be sure  but oddly magical  and the sequence which lovingly explores eddiedirks bedroom  completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic s figures  farrah fawcett  cheryl tiegs  bruce lee  is breathtaking  \\nably supported by a wellselected collection of period music  all of which purportedly came straight from mr  andersons personal collection   theres a clear affection for the era in boogie nights  \\nits the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline  the films promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters  \\nafter the debacle with s milos forman film  the people vs  \\nlarry flynt  another finelycrafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornographyrelated storyline  the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public  \\nhowever  while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago  its hardly a lurid or seamy film  given the subject matter  theres very little nudity  and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous  and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality  but simply as a business  \\nthe glimpses on the sets of jack horners shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate  theres a candid matteroffactness in terms of sex  his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job  and its refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking  such as coercion or debauchery  are avoided  \\nif anything  boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves  \\njack horners dream is an honourable one  he genuinely aspires to make a great film  and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood  albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence   \\nin both films  the world of quickie lowbudget filmmaking is explored  and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton  scott alexander  and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets  jacks retort of  there are shadows in light  baby  to his cinematographers complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed woods  its not about the little details  its about the big picture   \\nrant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan  from outer space appears patently false  \\nin boogie nights and ed wood  the aspirations of the respective filmmakers prove to be bemusing  not in their intentions  theres nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an artistic erotic picture  but in the degree that they miss the mark  \\nmuch like the humour lacing ed wood  the laughs involving jack horner are doubleedged  after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres  when jack breathes  this is the best work ive ever done   its genuinely funny  but given his utter sincerity  also possesses a tinge of sadness  \\nmr  anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter  \\nwhile boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging  there really isnt any clever dialogue in the film  though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the films characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges  when one considers that the films  protagonist  literally doesnt say a single insightful thing throughout the entire  minute running time  its no wonder why the playfully inane  how much can you bench   \\nbanter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the films finest exchanges  \\nand while mr  anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters  its problematic that some of the the threads given to the films characters are simply stale material  julianne moores child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff  better suited for a less risque and uninspired tvmovie version of her characters story  and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions  \\nstill  even if he doesnt always know what to do with his characters  mr  anderson most definitely captures their essences  and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious  misguided  even aimless  hopelessly naive  selfdestructive  insufferable  i loved them just the same  \\nin any case  its hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired  and ultimately bestexecuted  scenes of the year  a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loosecannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson  a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance  even if its a small one  in a suicidal drug deal scam  only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric  the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night rangers  sister christian  on his stereo system is sheer brilliance  flanked by an armed bodyguard  \\nif this scene already wasnt tense enough with these elements  mr  anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene  who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room  pushing the scene to a new  surreal level of delightful giddiness  \\nthere are some other interesting touches in boogie nights  \\nmr  anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight  here  it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect  \\nsimilarly  a painful scene where crew member scotty j  philip seymour hoffman  breaks down in tears in the drivers seat  sobbing  im so stupid  after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the drivers seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening  \\nboogie nights is exceedingly well cast  and each of the actors rise to the occasion  the ensemble cast is uniformly good

wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation  \\nworth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad  and deadon period  it sure sounds like bad early s to me  demo track  you got the touch  in a vain attempt

hazel eyes  looks like a disney animated heroine come to life  or in this case  a disney animated heroine who came to life  made a wrong turn  and ended up on the new line lot in a film focused on the late s  early s adult film industry  \\nconsequently  its a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweetfaced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates  but in a scene where shes lounging in a limousine prowling the streets  garish red lipstick messily smeared on  giving the camera a hilariously pouty comehither look  all one can do is gulp  \\nher role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out  err  in a figurative sense   shes essentially a glorified extra  but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity  \\n  if only mr  anderson had

to take a part in the twisted cult classic heathers  since then  her most notable roles have been as a junkie  gus van sants drugstore cowboy  and now a porn starlet  \\ndraw your own conclusions  \\nperhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr  cheadle  who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity  and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashion  \\nhis relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st  vincent  an interesting melora walters  is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness  and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible  its no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry  \\nwhile the scenario is familiar  the wounded look in cheadles eyes makes the scene unforgettable  \\nluis guzmans most famous work is possibly in brian de

the clique and constantly hounding jack  with little disguise made of his desperation  for a part in one of his erotic pictures  \\njacks eventual acquiescence to maurices request leads to one of boogie nights biggest comic payoffs  \\nboogie nights is a stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction by mr  anderson  who immediately asserts his presence in the film industry as a presence of note with this work  \\nstriking a fine balance between humour and drama  and exceptionally wellcrafted  theres no doubt that boogie nights is among the very best films of the year  \\n',\n",

follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years  \\nfor shyamalan  the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners  \\ndoes this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash  though  \\nthe answer to that question is not a very easy one  either  \\nas far as pacing goes  the sixth sense seemed almost interminable  \\nit wasnt until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally  and perfectly  paced in order to give the audience ample time to reconnect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached  \\nfor unbreakable  shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which  in many ways  blows away the film that had come before  \\nthe story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalans direction is excellent  with the camera almost constantly moving  \\nthere are tons of great shots in the film  not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis character and another train passenger  \\nthe shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak  \\nalso very impressive is the films score by james newton howard  who also scored shyamalans sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes  as well as this years dinosaur   \\nseveral of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film  \\none of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to  exercise  his powers  \\nthe music  in combination with the stellar visuals  really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie  \\nif there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year  this one would be it  \\nthe film also boasts some great performances  including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment  \\nwillis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne  who just cant seem to figure out why hes been depressed for the last few years  \\nhis character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him  but he eventually grows into his own under elijahs tutelage  \\njackson is one of the better actors of our time  and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah  \\nthough his hairstyle is absurd  jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked  \\nrobin wright penns role seems slightly underwritten  but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her characters need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again  \\nspencer treat clark  as the dunnes young son jeremy  shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors  and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film  \\nout of all the characters  jeremys is perhaps the most emotional  and clark does a great job with the role  \\nwhere the film does lose points though  is during its  surprise  ending  \\nshyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense  but i found myself saying  that was it    \\nwhen unbreakable revealed its own ending  \\nits not that the ending is bad  its just that the ending doesnt quite have the emotional punch that the other films did  \\nplus  it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels  and i wont reveal the ending here  but youll understand what i mean when you see it   \\nessentially  what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable  \\nthe only real problem is that the ending doesnt quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor  \\nas long as it isnt held to the standard that sixth sense set  which it ultimately will be   it should be a remarkably well liked film  \\none thing seems clear  though  \\nshyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film

       " 'steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities  because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits  like jurassic park  and  oscar  awarded critical triumphs like schindlers list  \\nhowever  in the s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories  \\none of them is close encounters of the third kind  extremely popular and influential sciencefiction spectacle  \\nunfortunately  it had a bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars  \\nalthough both films have a lot in common  groundbreaking special effects  brilliant score by john williams  their future was different  one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon  and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow  \\nwhen spielberg began work on that project  he was already established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit  jaws  \\ntogether with other young directors of his  new hollywood  generation  like kauffman  carpenter  hill and millius  he exploited the great creative freedom of s  when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment  \\nironically  it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of  blockubuster  philosophy  \\nbut in the mid s  many things were different  spielberg was young and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie  \\nalthough very personal  spielbergs screenplay was partly based on the book  ufo experience  by dr  j  allen hynek and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww  \\nspielberg was not only inspired by the mythology  but his movie also gave the mythology itself a huge boost  unmatched until the contemporary era of xfiles and the roswell anniversary  \\nthat was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic uforelated incidents as the element of the plot  \\nthe story begins with one of such incidents  team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u  s  navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight   \\nsuch events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary  richard dreyfuss   power company worker from muncie  indiana  who later becomes obsessed with his experience  \\nbecause of his obsession he loses his job  family and sanity  but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler  melinda dillon   single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction  \\nin the meantime  the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and u  s  government  in cooperation with the french  led by lacombe  francois truffaut  begin with the preparation for ultrasecret project  \\nwhen the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary  he finally sees some sense in all his visions and begins the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area  \\nthere he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions  \\ntwo of them must break through military pickets and reach their destination to find whatever is there  \\nspielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects  \\nthe slow  gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents   close encounters   is set in order to bring the viewer to the great revelation in the finale  \\nbut  instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during the jaws  we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder  \\nthroughout the movie the viewer knows that something big  magnificent and wonderful is about to happen  and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end  \\nthe last sequence  with its  even in this age  impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull  would leave many mouths open  \\none of the great virtues of this film is its optimism  \\naliens  who almost always get portrayed as the monsters in sciencefiction cinema  are here benevolent and harmless creatures and the first contact between them and humanity is a beginning of something wonderful  \\nit is very ironic  when we consider that the two classic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story  howard hawks thing and byron haskins war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind  \\nspielbergs humane approach and faith in the future also lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era  the only hint of the contemporary gloom is postwatergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public  \\nbut  even such government is much more harmless compared to the murderous and chainsmoking men in black that became the stereotype thanks to xfiles and its more cynical and disturbing visions  \\nthere lies the main  and probably the only flaw of this great picture  lack of conflict  and consequently  lack of drama  \\nthe movie has few excitements or even action scenes  especially the last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcocks north by northwest  but generally  almost everyone  neary  jillian  government  aliens  are the good guys  \\ndespite such shortcomings  the actors were good and manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles  \\nrichard dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary  yet nice guy  who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in a grand finale  \\nmelinda dillon was  on the other hand  nominated for  oscar  as a struggling mother  yet she was overshadowed by teri garr as nearys longsuffering wife ronnie  \\napart from visual wonders of this film  spielbergs semiofficial composer john williams again excels by his beautiful music  this time using the simple melody both as the element of a plot  and as the basis for his score  \\nthe aliens  who are the main subject of this film  were visually very convincing  \\ntoo convincing  one of my acquaintances in the uforesearching circles said  \\naccording to him  the depiction of extraterrestrials as greyskinned little people with big eyes was so accurate  that it managed to freak out powerful government figures interested in suppressing the truth about ufos  \\nso  they later approached spielberg and ordered him to make another movie with alien  this time designed to be anything but the real life  \\nthe result was e  t   for many years the biggest commercial hit of all times  yet less inspirational for ufo enthusiasts  \\nanyway  whether the viewer believes in existence of extraterrestrials or ufos  close encounters of the third kind remains the great movie  and one of the rare uplifting experiences in

       " 'with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink  the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories  quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the  film noir  genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control  fargo  millers crossing  blood simple   and offthewall comedies centered around an eccentric  scatterbrained lead character  raising arizona  the hudsucker proxy   \\ntheir latest offering  the big lebowski  falls within the latter category  though there are elements of the crimegonewrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film  \\nthe main difference  however  is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didnt quite have the brains to get it all together  the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy whos wise to the world  but he doesnt really want to do much of anything besides go bowling  smoke pot  and generally relax  \\nthat main character is jeffrey  the dude  lebowski  jeff bridges   introduced by the films rambling narrator  sam elliott  as  quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county   \\nthe dude is unemployed  needless to say  and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends  walter  john goodman   a borderlinepsychotic whos in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebodys cheating in a bowling match   has the whole world gone crazy    he shouts at a suspected cheater   and donny  steve buscemi   whos always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it   donny  you have no frame of reference here     \\nthese three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments  and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana  john turturro   who  when we first meet him  is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of  hotel california  and  if its possible  seems to be even more of a head case than walter  \\nif that doesnt give you a good idea of this films absurdist tone  then perhaps this will  the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dudes rug  \\ntheyve mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the  big  lebowski  david huddleston  and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny  tara reid  owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn  ben gazzara   \\nthe dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug  he doesnt have any luck  but when bunny is apparently kidnapped  the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the  million ransom  \\nunfortunately  walter gets involved and fouls up the dropoff  and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers  the dudes car gets stolen  along with the briefcase containing the money  \\nsoon  the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german  nihilists  who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place  the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn  \\nmeanwhile  the big lebowskis daughter maude  julianne moore   a feminist avantgarde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked  wants to recover the money for her family  \\nthe plot  however  is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc  \\nthe previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revivals  run through the jungle   and it fits  the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases  with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble  usually unsuccessfully   \\nthe film doesnt feature quite as many oneliners and sight gags as the coens other comedies  though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor  particularly in the dudes dream sequences and acid flashbacks   but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact  \\nthe film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result  you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this  jungle  but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations  but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution  \\ntheres also a noticeable  but not too heavyhanded  thread of social commentary in the big lebowski  which  incidentally  takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin  at the beginning  we see george bush on television making his  this aggression will not stand  speech  \\nthe coens take aim at just about every elite l  a  subculture in the book  the egotistical wealthy businessman   the bums will always lose   \\nshouts the big lebowski at one point   the porn industry  the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their  peaceful beach community   and so on  \\nby the end  we really start to admire the dude  who almost certainly harbors the least  aggression  of anyone in this story  his passive resistance  emphasis on  passive   albeit  to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters  \\nhe also turns out to have a pretty wellfunctioning brain in his head  even if he doesnt like to use it very much  his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when hes getting a run around  and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end  \\nthe coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness  but they dont just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either  \\ni think that  more than anything  is what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy  it manages to approach characters like the dude and  to some extent  walter  with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatterbrained  \\naudience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the undynamic duo by the end of the movie  given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first  \\n  its good knowin hes out there  the dude  takin it easy   posits the narrator towards

       " 'oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with  \\nin a perfect world   a civil action  would be a breath of fresh air  \\nits cynical about lawyers in a way that grisham isnt  \\nits romantic in the exact opposite way a grisham bookfilm isnt  \\nand  the capper  it has no distinct ending  and the law in hollywood films is that above all else  you must have an ending  \\neven if its based on a true story  a true story which hasnt yet ended  you must supply an ending  a false one  but an ending nevertheless  \\nhell   a civil action  is even more sly and more witty than any of the grisham works put together  and that includes  the firm   the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as a classic   \\nyet its also oddly and slightly unsatisfying  \\nweird  \\nthis is  in fact  a steve zallian film  not just the work of a hack  and zallian is the director of the muchadmired  search for bobby fischer   didnt see it  and writer of none other than  schindlers list   \\nin short  i like this guy  and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories  \\nafter all  apart from the obvious itsaholocaustfilm and itsaspielbergfilm  isnt  schindlers list  just a damn brilliant film  not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study  \\n  a civil action  is the same way  its narrative is split between being a lawyer film and being a character study  \\nand its here that the film seems to go a bit wrong  \\nthe main complaint of this film is that while  yes  its an engrossing lawyerly tale  it has no real ending  and thats not necessarily the problem with the film  \\nits that its just kind of unsatisfying  \\nif this were a great film  it would feel complete  and still end basically the same way  \\nbut this film just seems to end  and i dont want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on  imagine  if you will  being one of those the film is about  looking forward to this film  and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter  just so the many wont bitch about what is  essentially  genuine  \\nbut the fact that it just ends is not  in all actuality  what is wrong with it  \\nits rather that zallian has chosen  in the last half hour  to adandon the traditional lawyer story  and chose the other part of his story  the one about the lawyer  one jan schlictman  john travolta   whos shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer  brilliant because hes manipulative and he always wins  \\nit wishes to make it all about jan in the end  but the truth is  his change  although nicely done  is not full  \\nwe see him suffering from a personal crisis  and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart  but in the end  we dont fully believe it  \\nand i think that the problem is when he has made his decision  the film choses an odd angle to go at  a noble one  but one that gives the films conclusion that of incompleteness  \\nin the opening of the film  we see him doing his old schtick  manipulating courts  winning cases effortlessly  and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases  \\nin short  hes full of bullshit and we know it  \\nin the film  he takes a case that is hardly desired  a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river  \\npoint one  its not of the usual criteria  jan points out  wickedly  that dead or wounded children arent nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success   \\npoint two  it has been through several lawyers  \\nafter turning them down  jan changes his mind  a muddled scene  he stops his car on a bridge  looks out    is he feeling a sense of overachievement    and he and his team of lawyers  tony shalhoub  zeljko ivanek  and accountant william h  macy  head out to the town to do battle with the towns company  \\nthey spend millions of dollars examining the land  test the water  what have you  this is where stephen fry  a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in  wilde   pops up thanklessly   and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children  and then  unsuccessfully  the workers at the plant  \\nthey also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company  the eccentric jerome facher  played by robert duvall  more on him later on   \\nas we progress  we get so involved in the way the story is being told  which is engulfing everything around it  including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople  one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland  who lost her child  who begins to have a personal crisis   \\nthings begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half  as they are up against impossible odds  the judge  john lithgow  is not only a strickler  but a pal of facher  the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify  no concrete evidence is being found  depsite the money spent to find it  and they are quickly running out of money  \\nas macy mortgages everything he can  including their homes and their office  he slowly loses his sanity  his meatiest role since  oh   fargo    and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist  \\nin fact  the last half hour is such a change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par  owen gleiberman  especially  criticized the film for not being overlydramatic    i \\nsuppose like a grisham novel   \\nthis wouldnt be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is  instead of having a change of heart and automatically being perceived as good  hes seen as being still full of bullshit  \\nbecause he doesnt take stock in the cares of his partners  and causes them all to lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town  he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how to bring that out  \\nthe final half tries to redeem this  as must have been the point of making this in zallians mind  but what follows is a series of scenes where we merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs  and though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when hes seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes to employ him  and thusly receiving two speeding tickets   we still feel that the big change in his life is that hes not rich and esteemed anymore  the films final title card is witty but in all actuality shallow   \\nthe fault is not that there is no closure to the court case  its still going on  you know   but that its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in the final one it has  \\nwe need to feel like the character has really made a big change in his life  and that the story is how a story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such a whopping change in his personal life  \\nit only feels like half of that  \\nmaybe even less  \\nand its not travolta  who does a great job here  though never to be a truly memorable performance of his   but rather zallian  whose final chapter needs a rewrite  \\nup to then  though  its an engrossing drama  one of the best of the year in fact  and one of the best lawyer films  period  \\nthe reason is because it recognizes that a court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted  but rather its about the lawyers  the knights who battle eachother  \\nwe learn that the company is almost positively to blame for the deaths in the town  but the reason it cant be blamed is because it has the best prosecution you can find  \\nand duvalls facher is such a brilliant character and he does such a magnificent job at portraying that man that its almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is  \\nfacher is seen as an elderly man  a goofy eccentric  carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it  eating lunches out of paper bags  and making a point to take time out of his day to listen to the radio  and scold anyone who interupts him  \\nbut look deeper and you see a master at work  his evil and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him  and its difficult as hell to clearly generalize him in any way  \\nthats why i liked this film  its hard to put a pointer on  \\nyou can never see exactly where this film will land  and even when the credits roll  you still arent sure what to make of it  \\ncall it the zallian effect  \\nsame thing happened with  schindlers list   not that im comparing oskar schindler to jan schlictman   \\neach film is so greatly crafted that you cant help but get involved in its broad storytelling  interesting characters  and  most peculiarly  the wit that comes along with it  \\nif only it felt totally complete  like  say   schindlers list   though at this point it may be unfair to make comparisons between the two   it might have been one of the best films of the year  and along with that  a full breath of fresh air  \\n',\n",

and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast  indeed  eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot  kubrick  a renowned perfectionist  reportedly held his cast  hostage  on the set for nearly a year   \\nin an uncharacteristic maneuver  kubrick cast two bigname stars in the lead roles  namely reallife husband

       " 'note  some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  \\nbe forewarned  \\nmilos formans first film since the illfated valmont  columbias the people vs  \\nlarry flynt  is a vastly entertaining  if not particularly enlightening  biopic of hustler publisher and selfmade millionaire larry flynt  who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late s and early s  \\nthe film unweaves its tale in a chronological order  we open with young and dirtpoor larry flynt and his brother jimmy  peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky  \\ncut to forward in time  where the two flynt brothers  now young men  are running the struggling hustler gogo clubs in cincinnati  \\nthe strip clubs are in a dire financial state  and in a lastditch effort to salvage the operations  flynt decides to go to a print shop and churn out a promotional newsletter  \\nthis evolved into the adult periodical _hustler_ magazine  creating larry flynt a vast financial empire  and the rest is history  \\nwhat sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material  and who railed and preached against him  flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt  and his driven  singleminded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression  regardless of personal cost  \\nthe people vs  \\nlarry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynts true love  althea leasure  whom he meets as a dancer in his club and later marries  and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations  \\nconsidering the serious nature of the films theme  the importance of the united states first amendment  the people vs  \\nlarry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully lighthearted and humourous  \\nmuch of the comedy is elicited from larry flynts outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances  some of his chosen apparel is hilarious  and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points  such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at a free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity  \\nthe films focus is on the flynts many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech  but the heart of the people vs  \\nlarry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea  \\nlarry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff  harsh  and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues  but with althea  we see his loving  affectionate side  \\ntheres a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking  \\nultimately  the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors  but from the strength of flynt and altheas love for each other  \\nwoody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a careertopping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt  \\nharrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience  and a very compelling protagonist for the film  \\ncourtney love plays althea leasure in a startling turn  completely raw and impulsive  \\nits a very solid performance  brash and naturalistic  and love is extremely compelling  its difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen  and her chemistry with harrelson is deadon  \\nedward norton  as flynts straight  levelheaded lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier costars in the people vs  \\nlarry flynt  much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes  but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film  \\none can sense the frustration that nortons character feels when harrelsons freetalking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind  and this results in a heightened emotional punch when nortons isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges  \\nmilos forman keeps the film moving  although it runs over two hours  it never drags  and his direction of the film is very effective  eliciting a great deal of empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic  \\ntheres also a great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot  which is both clever and extremely entertaining  \\ntwo minor quibbles with the film  it certainly seems like the people vs  \\nlarry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme  with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech  \\nconsequently  the first thirty minutes of the film  introducing and setting up the characters  seem unduly rushed  perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these characters are so interesting  but i felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in a more leisurely fashion  \\nit also felt like there was a distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters  the film clearly shows what flynt  althea  isaacman  and rev  jerry faldwell did  and on a superficial level some of their motivations  but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on a deeper level  \\nfor example  why larry flynt was compelled by ruth carter stapleton  president carters sister  to be bornagain is a mystery to me  \\nthen again  perhaps it was to him as well  \\nthese two points dont detract greatly from the film  \\nthe people vs  \\nlarry flynt is certainly among the very best studioreleased films of   and works both as a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression  and as a touching love story  \\n',\n",

       " 'whenever writerdirector robert altman works in a specific genre  he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms  \\nhe made the west dirty in  mccabe and mrs  miller      he parodied hardboiled detective stories in  the long goodbye      and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with  popeye      \\nthe same holds true for his most recent film   the gingerbread man   which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years  the john grisham movie  \\nby the time  the gingerbread man  was completed  there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham  \\ntheres no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise  matthew mcconaughey  chris odonnell or matt damon  and it doesnt feature a great showdown in a courtroom  \\ninstead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession   the gingerbread man  is a rainsoaked  southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters  a twisting plot line

\\nhe is older  experienced  and rich  he drives a cherryred    mercedes that never gets dirty  even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah  georgia  where the story unfolds  \\nrick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife  leeanne  famke janssen   and he rarely gets to see his two children  jeff  jesse james  and libby  mae whitman   \\na reason is never given for the divorce  but

drives her home because her car has been stolen  and they end up in bed together  \\nrick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father  dixon doss  robert

\\ndixon is put in a mental hospital  but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out  \\nfrom there  the story delves into kidnapping  murder  doublecrossing  and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the action  \\naltmans cinematographer  changwei gu  gives the film a dark  soaked look  \\nif it isnt nighttime  at least its raining  \\ngu shoots the interiors

\\naltman has worked in just about every conceivable genre  from westerns to epic dramas to comedies  \\nbut  no matter what the genre  he is always sure to give it the altman stamp  which usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed without repeat viewings  \\n  the gingerbread man  is no different  although his style is much more restrained here  \\nhowever  without those little touches  the film could have easily slumped into a routine actionthriller  \\na great deal of the credit for the films success can be given to the actors  especially branagh  who rarely works outside of period pieces and his own direction  \\nhere  the british actor consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl  while making an essentially contemptible character interesting and sympathetic  \\nrick is an extremely flawed man  but branaugh brings real humanity to his character  \\nwithout it  the entire film would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling ricks pain and frustration  \\nthe supporting actors also put in fine performances  including embeth davidtz  who is probably best known for her heartbreaking role as the jewish maid in  schindlers list      \\ntom berenger provides some gruff comic relief  and robert duvall spends most of his onscreen time just looking weird  \\nit doesnt seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue  but watch him closely during the films one courtroom scene  his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language  and few actors could have pulled it off without being either silly or overbearing  \\nwhile  the gingerbread man  isnt in league with altmans greatest works like  nashville     or  the player      it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking  which may prove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career  \\nsome critics love to stamp films like this as  commercial   as if altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audience and dont make money  \\naltman has done something much better  he took what could have been a generic movie  and by investing artistry and effort  he made it into something more  \\n',\n",

the cult classic the rocky horror picture show  \\nthe story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend  \\nin the early s  stage actor turned firsttime playwright richard obrien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy bmovies he had grown up with as a child  set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design  \\nthe result was the stage play the rocky horror show  which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in  and was even hailed the best musical of  by prominent drama critics in england  \\nthe play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later  in october of   \\nthe film version  now titled the rocky horror picture show  was released in     \\nand immediately tanked at the box office  \\nwhether it was because fox wasnt quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didnt quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined  but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop  \\nit seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters  \\na year later  something entirely strange and magical happened  \\nprints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country  and it was then that a whole new audience found the film  \\nthis new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film  acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played  yelling rude comments at the screen  and just generally having a good time  \\nword quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture shows life as the ultimate cult film was born  \\nfor the virgins out there who are unaware  the plot centers around a loving couple  brad majors  barry bostwick  and janet weiss  susan sarandon   who come from a small town called denton  \\nbrad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed  \\nthey plan a trip to see the

had seen back a few miles down the road  they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance  \\nthe castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual  in the galaxy of transylvania   who are lead by the eccentric fishnetstocking wearing mad scientist dr  franknfurter  tim curry   \\nfranknfurter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky  peter hinwood   \\nas rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment  brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of franknfurters mad schemes  \\nlittle do any of them know that the doctors handyman  riffraff  original author richard obrien   and domestic  magenta  patricia quinn   are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth  \\ngoing back and revisiting this film after ten years   being the first time i had ever seen it   it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has  \\nif i had been a fox executive around the time of its release  i dont think i would have known what to make of it either  \\nfor all intents and purposes it is a bad movie  though bad in a really good sort of way   but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film  \\nby the time the credits role  it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters  and one really gets the feeling that richard obrien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy bmovies his film is based on  \\nwhen i say that the walltowall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that  once you hear them  they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity  \\nit goes without saying that the  time warp  is the most popular song in the film  \\neven people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song  \\nwhat those who havent seen the movie dont know though  is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment  \\nmy personal favorite is  over at the frankenstein place   but  dammit janet  is also maddeningly catchy  \\ntim currys vocals on the rocking tune  sweet transvestite  need to be heard to be believed  \\nthe finale of the film  a big floor show staged by franknfurter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets  including barry bostwick    \\nfrightening    features no less than four songs   rose tint my world    dont dream it    wild and untamed thing   and  im going home    all of which are immensely singable  \\nthe films true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though  \\ndespite the catchiness of the songs  this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadnt have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show  \\nwatching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans  unless you dont mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place   \\nnote  director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film  in the form of a sequel  resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment  which picks up with brad and janet  this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper   as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton  \\nthe two are menaced by the evil tv station manager  also played by de young   who wishes to claim janet as his own  \\nobrien returned as a writerperformer on the project  as did quinn  campbell  and gray in performance capacity only   but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original  \\n years later  this film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world  \\nas a lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans  a brand new special edition disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date  even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its th anniversary   \\nif you are one of those people who cant get enough of the film  this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites  \\nin an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film  fox home entertainment has released this wonderful disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that itll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all  \\nthe film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of       enhanced for x televisions   \\nthe film is presented in two different versions  the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called  superheroes   \\nfor ambitious viewers  the disc also includes a hidden version  located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner  which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen  \\noriginally  the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz  with the first half of the it seen in black and white  and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number   \\nmost reports  including a documentary on the disc  say that the color was supposed to appear when franknfurter first shows up in the elevator  but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version  depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced  \\nthe film contains a commentary track by show creator  and faithful handyman  richard obrien and costar patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable  and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and halfnaked on freezing cold sets  which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews   \\nthe two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell  but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore  and there are quite a few   \\nfox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments  \\nthe first feature  and the most simple  is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is  \\nthe second feature is an audience participation track  which lets you in on what you might hear on a good night out at the show  \\nmost of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off  but every once and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit of laughter  \\nthe final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd  where a pair of lips will appear onscreen during certain scenes of the film  mostly during the musical numbers  that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote  \\nwhen selected  you will be taken out of the film and into a live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world  \\nonce the segment is over  you are deposited right back into the film where you left off  \\nthe first disc also contains a few dvdrom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player  \\nthere is a timeline of the evolution from the stage play version to worldwide cult sensation  a video jukebox  a you dont know jackstyled trivia game  which is about as bare bones a you dont know jack parody as it can be   and a bizarre madlibs styled word game known as riffraffs story lab  \\nlinks to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvdrom portion of the disc  \\nthe second disc features even more goodies for the person who loves extras  \\nformer literock video channel turned music historians vh have allowed some of their outtake footage from the  behind the music  rocky horror  special that they ran earlier in the year to be shown here  as well as a popup video for the meat loafsung  hot patootie   \\nthe  behind the music  segments are all very interesting  especially richard obriens jaunt through the castle  which is now a hotel   where the film was originally shot  \\nthere are also extensions of the sarandon  bostwick  quinn  obrien  and meat loaf interviews  \\nas far as extras for the film itself go  there are two deleted musical numbers that are also included here  \\none of which is just the  superheroes  number available in the uk version  but there is also another rare musical number presented here called  once in a while   \\na series of alternate takes are also presented here  but none of them are really much of a revelation  except for the undressing scene in which we see that patricia quinn is having a hard time unbuttoning barry bostwicks pants   \\nfor the completist who must have every little bit of rocky horror paraphernalia  a misprinted end sequence and alternate credit sequence are also presented here  \\nrounding out the disc is a decent documentary called rocky horror double feature video show  two theatrical trailers  proclaiming that the film is  a different sort of jaws    a still gallery  and two singalongs  for  toucha toucha touch me  and  sweet transvestite    \\nfoxs special edition

italian films are finally getting their recognition in the u  s   but even long standing traditions are finally receiving their due on the wonderful dvd format  \\nas with their excellent dvds of the abyss  fight club  independence day  and the sound of music  fox shows that they have most certainly made the commitment to provide the things that dvd lovers want  \\ni raise a toast to them  cue the

       " 'i rented  brokedown palace  last night blind  having heard nothing about it beforehand  and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws  \\nfor anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety  \\nthat is no easy task  \\nsuperficially  it bears an unfortunate  and not necessarily unintended  resemblance to several other movies  notably  return to paradise  and  midnight express   \\nas a result nearly every review of  brokedown palace  i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons  \\nthe consequence was nearly universal condemnation  which is a shame as this is a fine film  \\nfor those who have yet to view the movie  let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system  as was  midnight express   nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of  return to paradise   \\nin my view  if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrads acclaimed novel   lord jim   \\nproblematically  the basic storyline seems more than familiar  two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious setup involving a suave conman  a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world  justice  system  \\nthe girls are alice  claire danes  and darlene  kate beckinsale   \\ntheyre lifelong buddies who planned a highschool graduation trip to hawaii  and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents  \\nonce there  they find a  hotel and go sightseeing  which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside  \\nthey get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room  a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them  but they are saved from hotel security by a charming  friendly australian  nick  daniel lapaine   who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girls scam  \\nhe then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves  first toward alice  then toward darlene  \\nby now alarm bells are going off among viewers  \\nthe everpresent nick is too slick and his stories dont add up  to us  the girls  of course  are too naive to notice  \\nlong before it happens  were anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fasttalking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sittingducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag  literally  containing heroin  \\njust as predictably  the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prisonbound for a long stretch  \\nleft unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice  \\nfor those in need of a ready answer  might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girls fleabag hotel  \\nas one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed  the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyerfixer  yankee hank   bill pullam  and his thaiborn partnerwife  \\na recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the films tag lines   who do you trust    and hank is no exception although seasoned movie goers and those familiar with pullmans oeuvre will find few surprises  \\nmuch of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in shorthand fashion  \\nlou diamond phillips  for instance  plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who  while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank  withholds vital information at crucial moments  \\nis he part of a wider conspiracy  \\nwith an inherently powerful  if somewhat tired premise  the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama  a prison story  and a potential character study of american teens  their relationship  and what constitutes friendship between them  \\nthe result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful  with the girls interaction  hanks investigation  and the various trials and hearings  offering hope for their release  delivering tensionas does the foredoomed possibility of their escape  \\nif  brokedown palace  has a major flaw  it is its creators tendency  like timeconstrained tourists  to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction halfway down and return to the storys main avenue  \\nand  if that were all there was to  brokedown palace   it wouldnt be a very good movie  \\nbut i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and  in this  they succeeded  \\nfor the main theme of the movie  like the proffered name of its location  is freedomin all its permutations  \\nultimately  the other subthemes may be considered window dressing  \\nyoung and pretty  alice  danes  is an old soul  a wild  streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure  \\npresented as a perfect blend of yin and yang  dark and light  is her cautious best friend  darlene  beckinsale   \\ncleareyed and straightforward  alice is more complex than her friend  \\nshe comes from a poorer background  has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone  including her own father   \\nwhereas darlenes life is  ontrack   aimed at college  marriage  kids  a career  a suburban home  middle age and  fulfillment   alices is uncertain  unfocused  and yearning  \\none poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitorsfriends and relatives from home  whose lives continue while hers is in limbo  \\ntellingly  alice is present but not included  \\njust as revealing of their different personalities  when alice and dar first come to thailand  the openness and delight on alices face doesnt read as simple naivet   the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat  reaching toward the sun  she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom  while  dar  remains seated in the shade  \\n  brokedown palace  begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank  \\nhowever unintentional  its all alices fault  \\nshes responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents  to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand  to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick  \\n  in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a films beginning  darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison   \\ndar  of course  is the willing dupe which  in her view  confers innocence  \\nnever mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate  \\ndar is innocent  \\nit doesnt matter  \\nalice is the subject of this movie  \\nshe and her journey toward personal freedom  \\nalong the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their halfbaked sensibilities and materialistic goals  \\nin the end  that culture  like its representatives   yankee  hank and dars father  a  man who knows how to grease the wheels    proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girls tragedy  \\nthailands culture  contrary to most opinion  comes off much better by comparison  \\nit amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes  \\ni believe the filmmakers view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior  \\nthe thai  with the sole exceptions of a corrupt official and a spiteful prison spy  were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles  \\nthe girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the nativeborn  \\ntheir prison  in stark contrast to the probable reality  was no hellhole  being relatively clean and sunlit  \\nthe prison authorities demanded good hygiene  provided medical care when needed  and  hard manual labor  consisted of picking grass  \\nthe thai guards were authoritarian  what else   but certainly not routinely sadistic  \\nas for the thai justice system  the reasoning of the thai judges  during both an appeal hearing and in the films penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality  \\nfreedom has many faces and  brokedown palace  explores many of them  \\nin the extreme  we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit  \\nsome settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter  \\nbut freedom seldom comes without a price  \\nwhich is why the movies other tag lines are   what is your dream   \\nand  how far would you go   \\ni believe i could make a good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom  incarcerated or not  by films end is alice  \\nshe finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility  \\ni think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact  \\nkate beckinsales character might more properly be likened to the  released  temple bird referred to twice during the film   trained to fly back to its cage   \\nas the thai magistrate observed in the films climactic scene  the issue was always one of  character   and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that  freedom  is achieved within oneself  \\nif one thinks back over the movie  which character was transformed by their experiences  \\nincreasingly  the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations of kung fu womanfemale characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures  \\nhere  at last  is the story of a modern heroine  \\nin reading the many users comments  i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon  whether or not a person liked the movie  almost everyone praised the actors  \\nthink about that  \\nwhen was the last time you came away from a motion picture possibly hating it  but raving about all the performances in it  \\ndo yourself a favor  rent  brokedown palace  and watch it with a open mind  \\ntheres more there than meets the eye  \\n',\n",

of the most intriguing parts of the movie  \\nfor as good as the actors and setting were  star trek  insurrections special effects were surprisingly disappointing  \\nthey proved adequate  sometimes

maintains roddenberrys largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors  particularly star trek  first contact  though  dont get me wrong  the dark tones of

       " 'in the wake of the smashing success of  rumble in the bronx   its looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release  \\nrumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii  \\nthe version i have is a copy from the laserdisc  its widescreen and bilinguallysubtitled  as are most hong kong films these days  \\navailability over here in the united states is very limited  these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng  \\nthe subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read  the letters are white and a bit small  \\nalthough the american release will almost certainly be dubbed  this review is of the subtitled version  so please keep that in mind if youre reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it  \\nto be fair  i must admit that ive never been very fond of  periodpiece  martial arts moviesthe ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past  \\nperhaps its because most of those ive seen were filmed on inferior stock  with either butchered dubbing or allbutillegible subtitling  or perhaps its because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and  in many cases  all but nonexistant  \\nin fact  many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end  \\nor  for that matter  it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings  armour of god  rumble in the bronx  etc   tend to have more spectacular stunts  often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions  whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts  \\nhaving said that  i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above  is one of the better martial arts films ive seen  and i quite enjoyed it  \\nsurprised  \\nwell  so was i  \\ndrunken master ii is about a young man named wong feihong  played by jackie chan  who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu  \\nwhere he learned this style is uncertain  as his father  wong keiying  ti lung  is steadfast in his opposition to feihongs practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu  \\napparently  feihong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore  rather like paul bunyan is for americans  but ive heard very little about this  and could quite well be wrong  so ill leave analysis of that to the people who know it better  \\none of my friends points out that the character of wong feihong is also featured in the  once upon a time in china  movies  but i have not yet seen those  \\nthe plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy  as are the plots to many such films  but if youre watching a jackie chan film  odds are you arent expecting something on the order of  war and peace   \\nthe story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics  and hence  chinas cultural heritage  while overworking  underpaying  and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill  \\nhowever  this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the filmfeihongs perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend  supplicate his father  keep his  pregnant  mother  played by anita mui  from fighting  and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs  \\nthe macguffin that drives the plot  s  is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners  \\nin the beginning  feihong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identicallywrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer  \\nin the process  he clashes with another thief  who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng  \\nafter feihong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners lackies  thanks to some timely intervention by a generals son  a cameo appearance by andy lau  who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii    comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when feihong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng  \\nand so it goes  \\nand the plot thickens later on  such as when feihongs girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival  or when feihong and the thief  now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners  are attacked en masse  another grand kungfu movie tradition   but i think ive already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves  \\nlets move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies    the \\naction  \\ntheres plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie    of \\ncourse  in a kung fu film  thats to be expected  \\nhowever  this isnt just another kung fu movie  this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography  and jackie chan is a genius  \\nthe primary martial arts  style  featured in the film is drunken boxing  a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk  \\nfurther  for the purposes of this film at least  drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated    but \\ntheres a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor  \\nunder normal circumstances  the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid  but jackie pulls it off with flair  \\nthe kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper  so ill just say that the fightsespecially the big climactic fight at the endin themselves make the movie worth watching  \\nanother thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work  \\neven without motor vehicles  well  not counting a train   there are some remarkable stunts in this film  \\namong other things  jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals  not once  but at _least_ twice  if you count the outtake shown during the credits   \\n  quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database   \\nunlike in american films  these stunts are _not_ faked  \\ndrunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene  including jackie  ti lung   a better tomorrow       and anita mui  the  heroic trio  series   rumble in the bronx    \\nthe performances are firstrate  especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film  \\nthe scene where feihong and his mother conspire literally behind feihongs fathers back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious  as is the scene where feihongs mother  having just revealed that she is pregnant  is threatening to hurt herself  in order to draw her husbands anger away from feihong   \\njackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years  and hes in fine form all through drunken master ii  \\nas far as cinematography is concerned  it certainly works for this film  \\nits nothing spectacular  but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the s  \\nthe picture is crisp and clear  \\none thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that  at least in the copy i have  the screen was wider than any film ive ever seen on videotape beforealmost a whole  of the screen was blocked out above and below  \\n  watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can   \\nit will be an utter shame if this film is eventually panandscanned for american video release  \\ndrunken master ii shows the full potential of  period piece  kung fu movies  and its good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies  \\nthe plot does meander a bit  but thats to be expected in this type of film  \\nif you like this kind of movie  youll love this movie  and if not  well  give it a chance anyway  \\nif nothing else  the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental  \\n',\n",

american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie  genre  that ellis helped to create  \\nchristian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman  a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc  e and his colleagues  \\nit seems that bateman is a serial killer and  unfortunately for his contemporaries  his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip  \\nas he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering coworkers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies  his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel  \\ni was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school  \\ni read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it  \\nas usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out  but i soon forgot about the novel and didnt end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore  \\ni picked it up and read it  but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers  \\nthe movie has a similar effect  but at least its less cryptic than ellis novel  \\nfor once  a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on  \\nboth the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations  down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses  but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout  \\nthe movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in batemans impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does  \\nas a result  the film is immensely more entertaining  \\nlions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films  having picked up kevin smiths catholicrattling dogma  and here with american psycho there is no difference  \\nscreenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it  \\nsome cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc  mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women  and initial reports said the film was unwatchable  \\nthankfully  it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park  bigger  longer  uncut  \\nside note   cowriter guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an illfated acquaintance of batemans who  after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute  proclaims that shes not a lesbian nor has any interest in it  \\nthe ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner  the writerdirector of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy  is a lesbian  \\nits a subtle injoke and its one i found to be pretty humorous  \\ndespite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young upandcomers  including reese witherspoon   most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos  \\nthe real draw here is christian bale and his overthetop performance as patrick bateman  \\nwhenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters  \\ni always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman  but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being  \\nto say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that hes as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger  \\none sequence in particular  involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news song  hip to be square  right before burying an axe in a coworkers head  features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film  \\nside note   despite the fact that huey lewis  hip to be square  and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film  dont expect to see them on the soundtrack release  \\nhuey lewis expressly requested that his song  featured in a rather large set piece in the film  much akin to the use of  stuck in the middle with you  in reservoir dogs   not be included on any soundtrack release  \\nim assuming that collins requested the same  \\non a similar note  whitney houstons cover of  the greatest love of all  is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isnt the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source  \\napparently  houston wasnt as open about the use of her song as the others were  \\na bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the films release  that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film  \\ndont look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more  \\nseveral web sites have been dedicated to the subject but im still undecided  \\nthere is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops  old ladies  and cleaning staff with equal gusto  \\nthe scene seemed very dreamlike and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying  as an example  bateman blows up a police car very cinematically after firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the car   \\ni kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there  but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence  though comic  throws the film offbalance  which i suppose was the intention   \\nother than the few flaws i have mentioned  american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film  although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in batemans reality   \\ni think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such  \\nit may not change anyones life  but it will certainly have an effect  \\ni know i will certainly hear  hip to be square  in a different context the next time i hear it  \\nr \\n',\n",

a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel  and i wouldnt be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blondhaired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world   but her delivered lines seemed very flat  and i found myself looking for matt damons reactions instead  \\na good thing about rounders is that it doesnt get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it cant find time for humor  \\nthe film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going  such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next  in widely different locales  \\none game in a cigar club had me in stitches  \\n  i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper   says one of the players  clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other  \\ni was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys  \\nwith all the poker being played  rounders had the potential to be very confusing  \\nyou might think you know a lot about poker  but think again  \\nluckily  were given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain whats going on  \\nthe narrations are more informative than intrusive  and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do  \\nits nice that as the characters develop  so does our comprehension of their world  \\nas a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker  rounders delivers in spades  \\nwait  \\nas a film about the culture of cards  rounders is an ace  \\nhang on  \\npacked with great acting and great characters  rounders is a full house  \\nokay  i guess thats enough  \\noh  by the way  if you

       " 'historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early s  \\nfor many critics  scholars and  most importantly  film producers  it was a thing of the past  something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of blackandwhite television and noncgi special effects  \\nbut in   same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago  there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor  producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre  \\nand  same as in the case of dances with wolves  he was awarded for his effort with  oscars   \\nthe name of the film was braveheart  and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson  \\nthe plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace       \\nin his time  english king edward i  longshanks   played by patrick mcgoohan  has almost completely subdued entire british isles  including scotland  whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by  ius primae noctis  and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights  \\nalthough english had killed his father many years ago  young scottish commoner william wallace  played by mel gibson  doesnt care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron  played by catherine maccormack   \\nmurrons death changes that and wallace takes arms and  together with small but dedicated band of followers  begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country  \\nthrough time  more and more people join his ranks and in  wallaces ragtag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge  \\nbut the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves  especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce  played by angus macfadyen   who wouldnt like to have a simple commoner as a national leader  \\nbraveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson  so it wouldnt be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann  \\nhowever  even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre  \\nthe most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism  \\nwhile older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytalelike vision of picturesque castles  splendid costumes and knights in shining armour  gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard  short and brutish  \\nthis general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle  where handtohand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details  never seen since verhoevens ultranaturalistic flesh  blood  \\ncompared with this naturalistic approach  most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays  \\nbraveheart also employs humour at the right places  not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences  but also to underline its downtoearth atmosphere  so different from previous historical epics  \\nwhat makes braveheart  larger than life  is his protagonist  \\nmel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and  as a result  character of th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late th century comic book hero  \\nwallace is more than superior to his enemies  both physically and mentally  yet he is able to show his sensitive  more vulnerable side  \\nnaturally  when the character is based on epic poems  most of historical accuracy is going down the drain  which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in s   \\nhowever  even those who dont particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace  especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel  played by sophie marceau  and make her a child  \\nbecause of that the disbelief is hardly suspended  and final scenes arent as effective as they should be  \\nmel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful  and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors  \\nmost memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan  whose cold  calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema  \\nbrendan gleeson  who would later become famous for his role in boormans general  is also very good as wallaces trusted companion  as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosystricken king john balliol  \\ndavid oharra is very entertaining as wallaces irish ally  and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his consciencestricken character of robert the bruce  \\nwomen in this film have rather thankless roles  especially marceau as onedimensional french princess  \\ncatherine mccormack as wallaces wife was more interesting  but she was eliminated from the picture early on  \\nfrom the technical point of view  the film is also very good  \\nphotography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen  \\non the other hand  the musical score by james horner employs too much of modernday instruments for period piece set in medieval times  \\nalthough mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike  braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism  \\nthe main reason for that was the fact that gibson  among many historical facts  chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of  longshank  s son prince edward  played by peter hanly   \\nhe is not only presented as a villain  but also as one of the less competent in villains camp  and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in  politically correct  hollywood  \\nto make things even more obvious  good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward  rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals  \\nhowever  although the message of this film might look rightwing  it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in th century  \\naccording to that ideology  oppressed classes  workers  peasants  are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and  as such  they are more radical  less willing to make compromises and more efficient  on the other hand  privileged classes  aristocracy  bourgeoisie  are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges  \\nthis marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety  \\nin the end  whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic  braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre  \\n',\n",
       " 'if you had a chance to create a genetically perfect child  would you do it  \\n  gattaca  is a film which presents a future where society has answered  yes  to this question  but then ponders if this was actually the right decision  \\n  gattaca  came out only a couple months following the first genetically engineered creature  the lovable dolly the sheep  and with this in mind  the film only becomes more frightening  \\nthe way the realm of genetics is heading  it may only take a couple decades until the future  gattaca  presents becomes true  \\ncontrary to the misleading trailers   gattaca  is not a scifi thriller  in the way that theres lots of murder  hitchcockian suspense  and chase scenes  \\nthis is a quiet  sad film about intelligent theories  \\nin fact  the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley  the latter whos novel  brave new world  featured genetically engineered children   \\nits a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia  which is exactly what  gattaca  presents    and the main reason i dug it so much  \\nthe story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman  ethan hawke   a man with high hopes but a  chance of heart problems  and a prospected life span of around  years  \\nas a child  he was put down because of the threats of genetics  while his younger genetically perfect brother  anton  loren dean   was promised whatever his heart desired  \\nvincent yearns to be an astronaut  but when he gets a job at a giant space company  its as a janitor  ernest borgnine plays his boss    \\nbut one day  he finds out that its probably possible that his desires can come true in the form of a business deal brought out by a black market geneticist  or something   german   wings   tony shalhoub  who did like hundreds of cameos in films back in    men in black    a life less ordinary       whos client is a genetically perfect man  jerome morrow  jude law   who has unfortunately been crippled  \\nfortunately  though  theres no record of the accident  and hes willing to give someone else his life  \\nsince vincent looks a bit like him    \\nafter a couple alterations  some minor  some really major   he has donned the life of jerome  and is doing his job  \\nthere  he meets a genetically imperfect woman  irene  uma thurman  whos genetically perfect in real life anyway  hee hee   and the two begin a kind of relationship  albeit a very shallow one since romance is deemed by how great a mans stats are  \\nhowever  a murder of a highlevel worker at his office is killed  and one of vincentjeromes eyelashes is found by the anal retentive investigators headed by a semiwily inspector  hugo   alan arkin   and none other than vincents long lost brother  anton  who hasnt seen him since they were teenagers  \\nwe know vincentjerome didnt do it  but with his older picture being posted everywhere  not only vincentjeromes in trouble  but also the real jerome  whos as much in it as he is  \\nhowever  there isnt many big suspense set pieces  which is actually a blessing because if they were tossed in  the film would lose its message and descend into just being a scifi thriller a la william gibson  \\nthe suspense in the film comes from the idea that vincent and jerome can easily be captured just by dropping a hair or dead skin  \\nwhile there are several scenes which are pretty frightening  there are no big distractions from the point of the film  much to the dismay of commercial audiences  \\nwhat is actually portrayed is the lack of life in the utopian society that is created  \\nirene has no real spunk in her life  and is rather amazed by the sheer beauty of a sunrise rather than genetically perfect people  \\nand the genetically flawless jerome is in actuality a bitter man  claiming that his accident was really no accident  \\nwhat jerome has done is fool the system in giving a man who yearns for better things a chance at that  and the ending is shocking as its a definite work of dystopian propaganda  but doesnt have the down ending of other works of this kind  \\nthe production design of this film is probably the best ive seen this year  its stunning  very pleasing to the eye  but still very cold  \\nsince genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement  the world has cooled into a state of inhumanity  and the sets echo a sense of shallow misery  \\nand the sequence of all the highlevel workers doing their jobs has a kind of gilliamesque feel to it  showing the nightmare of slipping into a routine zombielike life  \\nthe ability to perfect people has left humanity cold and generally unhappy  \\nthe acting from everyone is great  with thurman giving a wonderfully cold performance  and hawke creating a character who has been beaten down by the system but has found a new sense of optimism by a bitter man who was willing to give it out anyway  interesting pointless fact  uma and ethan started dating after this film  and currently she is pregnant with his child   \\nbut the best performance belongs to jude law  who steals every scene hes in  and creates a character filled with the pessimism over having such a horrible burden placed on his burden  \\ni think that people are generally tempted by the fact that genetics can actually create perfection in a child  but whether or not they would actually act on this temptation is something im not sure of  \\n  gattaca  warns us not to go any farther  chiefly because well create a world of

clyde stole  mickey and mallory kill  \\nto examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them  expressed metaphorically as killing  subdues the mysterious power this film wields  \\nfor the most part  when mickey and mallory kill  they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily  they kill what is trying to kill them  they kill what dissembles and cowers from life  they kill what needs to be killed  \\nthis mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity  \\nbrahma created  \\nvishnu preserved  \\nand

the two are frequently indistinguishable  \\n  the state is the divine idea upon earth   hegel said  meaning it is absolute  allpowerful  ineffable  unassailable  infallible  authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh  allah  god  etc  \\nwell  what does all this have to do with natural born killers  \\nlet me first say that religions of this nature  in the ideal  take the place of sex  \\nconsider the catholic church  which in its heydey  took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever  \\ngod takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope  cardinals  bishops  monks  etc  they forego the one  in order to come closer to the other  \\nduring the middle ages  when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged  the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power  \\n  parenthetically  witness plato as well  \\nin the republic  he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime  \\nnot coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself  regularly assailing the passions   \\ncatholicism  as policy  attacks the passions as evil  \\nit sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure  \\nmasturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution  \\nthis is religion  this is authoritarianism in its essence  \\nas further evidence  the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters  \\nour culture  most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years  \\nwe cant help but adopt  even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes  leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self  \\nmickey and mallory knox internalized them  too  then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other  discovered them  and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves  \\nit is a straightforward liberation through sex  \\nas some good patriarch once observed   you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on   \\nmm had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions  \\nthey saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions  \\n  the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers   as mickey says  \\nas a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter  let us look each other in the face  \\nwe are hyberboreanswe know well enough how remote our place is  \\n  neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans   even pindar  in his

of the heart that  forgives  everything because it  understands  everything is a sirocco to us  \\nrather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such southwinds  \\nas far as i can tell  this is what the movie has to say  \\nits alleged critique of the media is only secondary  tertiary  quaternary  subsidiary for sure  \\nfor example wayne gayles first report ends with some gen x dude saying   if i were a mass murderer id be mickey and mallory   in his most excellent bill and ted voice  \\non one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical  impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes  \\nit seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what mm were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself hed be just like them  killing and destroying what deserves it  \\nlet me exemplify what ive been saying by analyzing a scene from the film  namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant  kills him  and then castigates him for giving her  the worst fuckin head ive ever had in my life     \\nnow  i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship  because demonstrably they didnt  and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this  \\nsometimes they are the source of each others frustrations  but unwilling to kill each other  since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation  they must kill in place of their lever  \\nits no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey  \\nas the attendant approached he took on mickeys character in the eyes of mallory  \\nshe needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory  \\nupon discovery  mallory views this as a betrayal  judges him  and commutes his sentence on someone else  \\nthe style of the movie is a whole nother matter that i wont get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power  \\nlet me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness  barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle  \\nthe rapid succession of all those mm  mm  mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish  frenetic mood  \\nalso  jungian archetypes abound  \\nthese cant help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames  \\nsome of the best scenes and lines that come to mind   quotes are paraphrased only   \\nmickey to mallory   one of these days im gonna be cummin for you   in prison  while mallory jacks mickey off  \\nsemen is a symbol for great potential and things to come  \\nat the time they havent yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet  \\nthe two of course go hand in hand  \\nfor an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs  \\nmickey during his marriage to mallory   as creator of my universe  i pronounce us man and wife   \\nthe way woody delivers this line is truly haunting  but telling  too  \\nit reveals mm are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones  \\nthis is what mickey means by  creator of my universe   he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes  \\nit is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears  \\nscagnettis first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendants mouth  \\nthe indian sage releasing mallorys father  who was reincarnated as a snake   old man  go be a snake   after telling his  snake story  that ends with  bitch  you knew i was a snake   \\nafter mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering nightmare  mallory says   you killed life     \\nthis is another telling quote because it implies they didnt see themselves as killers of life  \\nthen what were they killing up to that time  \\nin some case just those zombies faking their way through life  the living dead  as it were  \\nin other cases  all the antilife

       " 'its been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller  where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters  but its been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually  shock  cared for the characters  not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles  flaws  and strengths to emerge so radiantly  \\nid saw that its been at least a couple decades  even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers  though im hardly comparing  a simple plan  to  say   rear window  or  strangers on a train   \\nyet its almost as good  \\nits simple  yet strangely complex  and astonishingly rewarding  because instead of moving from plot point to plot point  and merely laying out theymightbecaught overtones  it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to  all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral  \\nelegantly directed by sam raimi  yes  the same    a simple plan  concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright  moderately financially stable working man  bill paxton   his dimwitted brother  billy bob thornton   and his drinking buddy  brent briscoe   \\nwithout anyone around  and the possibility that no one would come looking for it  the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes  they will keep it  but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking  and so they generally dont flaunt anything they dont want to flaunt  theyll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton  \\nthe possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse  a  they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities  b  they could try to fight off the rightful owners  who are either villainous or just  or c  they could fight amongst themselves  \\n  a simple plan   though borrows a little from each of these  \\na little tiff with the cops here  a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent  a chilling gary cole  there   and a bit of inside feuding over here  \\nbut  as austin powers would say  thats not necessarily its bag  baby   \\nwhat i most admired about this film  and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that its successfully able to have its cake and eat it too  \\nit effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches  like the ones mentioned above  but at the same time  it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag  \\nso while steps are taken to neatly cover things up  and these subsequent steps go miserably awry  the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to  they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity  \\nin one early scene  paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesnt look like it was all stolen  not a bad idea   when thornton screws up  as he does continuously throughout the movie   and paxton has to do some major coveringup  read  homicide   \\ninstead of a quick murder and immeadiate handswashing  raimi shows a lengthy  painful shot from a lowangle onto paxtons face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion  \\ntheres a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder hes committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective  but the previous shot is even better  more morally complex and more gutwrenching  \\nin short  probably the best piece of direction raimis ever done  demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results  for further proof  watch  persona  s  sex scene  and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergmans ever done   \\nbut the film hardly stops here  it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof  \\nyet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story  \\nwhen the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical  with aid from his pregnant wife  played by bridget fonda  a pal to raimi   he does  and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights  \\ntheres at least two grand shootouts  and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history  and when they arrive  they dont come with masochistic delight but with cringeinducing horror  \\nduring the one  i was actually sinking into my chair  with the mantra  they cant do this  can they   \\nstreeming through my head  \\nin fact  this film  which is getting many comparisons to the coens superior  but forget about it  fargo   has many similar moments of manic insanity  attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what  in other hands  would be overthetop distractedness  imagine  i suppose  robert rodriguez directing this    then \\nagain  after seeing the  evil dead  films  id hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off  although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed  raimi  moments  a rifleshot notwithstanding   \\ninstead  raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch  easily letting the story and characters coexist  while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out  like some offbeat comic touches  \\nmost particularly  billy bob thorntons character  jacob  is a brilliant creation  \\nhis dimwittedness is often hilarious  for most of the film  every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter   but theres authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that were not totally laughing at him  \\nthe chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of fullcondescension because thornton is so damn real  \\njacobs a multidimensional character  and while being stupid  we see that as not so much a flaw  but a strength to his character  his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system  primarily towards the middle where his bud and coconspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money  \\nthe final third of the film spends much time with him  and many of the touches upon his character  not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b  smith  adapting his own book  by the way  are just great  \\ni particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend  told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to nearsweetness and further strength of his saddened character  \\nthornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance  by far the best performance hes ever given and further proof that hes the best character actor in contemporary cinema  if you dont believe me  go back and watch his wonderful performance in  primary colors   a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadnt been in the same year  because hes easily able to slip into a character  and make him completely and utterly believable  \\nhe brings so much weight to the film that  as it is with most character actors  its difficult picturing anyone else in the role  \\nthe rest of the cast is great too  from paxtons declining working man to chelcie ross amiable town sheriff  \\neven fonda shows off her talents nicely  \\nand if i had any complaints about the film  its that the plot is almost too simplistic  and that at times  it seems too much like an exercise  like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved  \\nand the occasional narration is  as it usually is  annoying  narration should be used with extreme caution  especially when youre trying to set things up andor express emotions  didnt raimi watch the first murder scene    \\nand  the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie  the ending is basically amiss  \\ni wont reveal it  but its way too cruel and too much of an outsider setup  as if the appearance of a plane wasnt already too much of that anyway  \\nfor a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved  this is the wrong ending  \\nimagine a charactercontrolled ending  otherwise  its like if in  crime and punishment  if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing    not that im at all comparing  a simple plan  to dostoevsky  \\nthe ending does work  despite my protestations  but to me  there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it  but if you had no qualms and were happy as a clam with it  then just ignore me and go about your day  \\nbut despite my mere claims  make no mistake that i was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout  and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured  not because of any kind of gore factor  which is  thankfully for this  very minimal   but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that ive frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile  \\nat least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece

somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find  to their big surprise  that the majority of people vote republican  go to church every sunday and usually dont tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film  \\nsuch rude awakening  however  can happen in another direction  conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in  \\nsomething like that happens to jake van dorn  george c  scott   successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest of his community  \\none day his daughter kristen  ilah davis  disappears from calvinist youth convention in california  \\nvan dorn is worried because he doesnt believe that his daughter would run from home  \\nhowever  the truth delivered by private investigator andy mast  peter boyle  is even harder  kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic film  \\ninfuriated van dorn is

issues that writer and director paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt  \\nin late s  it was totally different situation  films were expected to have mature  serious themes for the mature audience  \\nfor schrader this film was nice opportunity to expand the subplot of his previous work  taxi driver  one that deals with the great generational divide that tormented the american society in s  \\non one side we have an old america that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great  \\nbut that america is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought by the social turmoil in s and  instead of facing them  prefers to live in rural  conservative cocoons  \\nthe new america  on the other hand  fares no better  ideals of the socalled  sexual revolution   same as all other  revolutions  of the swinging sixties  degraded into exploitation and depravity  \\ninstead of being  liberated   baby boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with the newly discovered freedoms  \\nschrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas  actually  arent so far away  nice example is a brilliant scene in which van dorn  already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist  meets sleazy porno producer  the latter one also turns out to be authoritarian  paternalistic and very dedicated to this job  \\nthe difference between the two is simply in the line of work  \\nmany contemporary critics actually accused schrader of promoting conservative agenda  \\non the surface  it may look that way  audience is forced to sympathise with van dorn and his quest  \\nin the first scenes  he is portrayed as nice family man who actually doesnt deserve to experience parents worst nightmare  \\nthe scene in the porno cinema that reveals kristens fate is extremely cruel  pain and humiliation  brought by oscarwinning actor george c  scott  is of such intensity  that the audience feels sorry for him and simply must support his agenda  \\nvan dorn is perhaps flawed  and the subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth at the end  but the viewers simply know that his cause is just  and that prodigal daughter must be better off with her loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only want to exploit her body  \\non the other hand  schrader  who grew up in an environment very much like van dorns  his own parents wouldnt allow him to watch movies until he was    knows better and tries to bring another side of coin  \\neven the people connected with sex underworld can show redeeming qualities  like nicky  who actually tries to improve her life  and sleazy detective who develops something like a conscience at the end  \\nunfortunately  schrader fails to erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning  and his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of america seems lost in somewhat clich  d finale  \\nthe script is slightly flawed  and schrader as director doesnt show too much originality  his style seems too influenced by techniques that scorsese used in taxi driver  \\napart from the scenes in grand rapids  those two films even look alike  \\nbut the content might be more than interesting for todays viewer  especially those inspired by the current s revival  \\nuntil boogie nights  no hollywood mainstream movie ever dared to explore the phenomenon of pornography in s  \\nhardcore  on the other hand  might serve as precious document  because it depicts sex film industry in the period often regarded as the golden age by connoisseurs  before the advent of video  when many of the porno filmmakers could afford to think of themselves as artists  \\nthe view of such age and the industry is very unflattering  though  but for the film whose main character takes time to explain calvinist doctrines to the audience  that shouldnt be too surprising  \\nanyway  despite some flaws  hardcore remains very interesting and powerful piece of cinema

seemed special and important  \\nnow its six years later and the wave has finally broken  as he puts it  \\nmaterialistic culture is still alive and well and  for most of this film  right in his face in las vegas  the  american dream  of which duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow and phony as ever  \\nthe social protesters have lost  and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as duke to drift in a sea of drugs and disillusionment  \\nin many ways  fear and loathing is gilliams most realitybased film  all of his others  with the exception of the fisher king  have made use of some sort of fantasy or sciencefiction plot elements  \\nyet it is his offthewall masterpiece brazil  to which this film bears the most visual resemblance  \\nthe protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic  soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and terrorist attacks  and similarly dukes world is composed of the artificial  empty glam of las vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations  \\nunlike the protagonist of brazil  however  duke is not a particularly admirable figure  and neither is gonzo  \\nduring the latter half of the film  their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse  eventually building up to an incident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens and humiliates a waitress  while duke  though he doesnt seem to approve  doesnt do anything to stop it either  \\nby the time this scene takes place  they dont seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more  they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner  \\nduke seems to realize at some level that hes become something he doesnt like  but hes either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change  \\nthis film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience  \\nwhile gilliam may have overdone it in a few places  i think he and his cowriters deserve more credit than that  \\ntheres plenty of substance here  particularly in the second half  its observations about the broken and defeated rebels from the s and the objects of their rebellion just arent usually very pleasant  \\nunlike  say  brazil  or the fisher king  both of which feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive environment  fear and loathing in las vegas  shows us someone whos given up on his dreams and resorts to the quick fix of drugs  \\nin its own psychedelic  whackedout way  its sad and regretful  but i think its also a bit of a kick in the pants  a challenge to find an alternative between chemicallyinduced withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of vegasstyle materialism  \\nindeed  duke himself admits at one point that hes never learned to accept that you can get higher without drugs than with them  \\nim not sure if hes any closer to accepting it by the end or not  but i suspect the audience will get the idea  \\n',\n",

       " 'i suppose an argument could be made that toy story is one of those films that didnt need a sequel  \\nbeloved by kids and their parents  respected equally by mainstream america and geekish movie buffs  that first movie remains a landmark of recent history  the one that burst open the possibilities of computer animation and demonstrated through wild invention and giddy chutzpah just how complacent the disney animation machine had become in cranking out fluffy razzledazzle entertainment full of formula storytelling and banal songwriting  \\nif disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own game  toy story was a smash hit of unexpected proportions  and one that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as demand for action figures far outstripped supply   it didnt show  and as distributor and partowner of the property  at least it had a piece of the action  \\ntoy story  was greenlighted as a directtovideo project  disneys standard tactic for milking a few more bucks out of hot franchises without expending the effort of developing a proper feature film  \\nas someone who doesnt believe sequels are necessarily a bad thing  granted  they usually are a bad thing  but thats because theyre made for the wrong reasons   i had to wonder what in the world they were thinking  \\nfortunately  disney claimed to have been so knockedout by early animation tests that they let pixar go fullspeed ahead with a theatrical sequel  \\nlucky thing  too  like the first movie  this one is a joy to behold on the big screen  and technically  it improves on its predecessor on just about every level  \\n  from a business standpoint  the end credits show that the new creations are copyrighted by pixar  while the previous films elements are shared between pixar and disney  a sign of the production houses new cachet in hollywood   \\nvisually  the main shortcoming of this fully computergenerated movie is that human figures are still rendered relatively poorly  making them look a little creepy  \\nfortunately  that eerie unreality fits in perfectly with the perspective of the movie  where the secret world of toys is more immediate  and arguably more attractive  than the world of the humans who surround them  \\nas before  the story is predicated on the premise that the toys scattered around the bedroom of a little boy named andy  and  indeed  all the toys scattered around the bedrooms of all little children  come to life in the childs absence  \\nwhile the toys scamper about and chatter endlessly among themselves  the real joy of a toys life is to mean something to its owner  \\none of the subjects of this new film is the sadness of toys that have been broken or abandoned  left on a shelf to gather dust  and another is the sort of emotional limbo inhabited by toys that are mere prizes of covetous collectors  \\nmost often  those toys are packed away in dark spaces  safe from sunlight and humidity  and often theyre not even removed from their packaging  \\nimagine what a chip that would put on your shoulder  and youll understand the attitudes of the collectors items that show up in this movie  \\nsheriff woody  voiced by a noteperfect tom hanks   the longtime favorite among andys toys who was challenged in the previous goround by the arrival of flashynewthing action figure buzz lightyear  tim allen   suffers an injury early in the film  when andy tugs too hard on his arm and pulls a seam apart  revealing the stuffing inside  \\nthis accident catalyzes some uneasieness among the toys  who know too well that a broken toy is often a forgotten toy  and a forgotten toy is one that loses its reason for existence  \\nthose anxieties are crystallized when andys mom tears through his living room  collecting old toys for a yard sale  \\nand theres an ironic twist to the tale  as woody winds up being stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactly that quaint cowboy figure to complete a set that he hopes to sell to a japanese toy museum for a sizable sum  \\nthe rest of andys toys  who owe him quite a debt  resolve to rescue him  \\nthat this film manages to turn a box marked   cents  into a symbol of doom  or to make its screed against the retention of collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel for a metaphysical dilemma  is a testament to its skill at metaphor  seamlessly translating the hopes and fears of our real world into that of the toys  \\noperating on this level of abstraction  toy story  tackles some mighty heavy issues without once preaching or veering into pretentiousness  \\n  the worst i can say is that randy newman seems to have reserved his sappiest lyric in years for sarah mclachlan  who stops the movie cold by singing it at just about the halfway mark   \\nsometimes i think toy story  tries too hard  \\ntheres somewhat less of the seatofthepants loopiness that energized the first film  allowing it to surprise and excite on a nearconstant basis  and more philosophizing about toys  collectors  the nature of happiness and the meaning of life  \\nwhile that leads to fewer bellylaughs  it does make way for more elaborate humor and an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity that asks the toys to consider their own status as commodities that move in and out of fashion  \\n  just dont ask why andys favorite toy is based on a tv series that was canceled in    \\nwhere else in mainstream movies do you get such an awesome moment as the one where buzz arrives at als toy barn to find it stocked to the gills with his doppelgangers  buzz lightyear action figures  \\nforget the selfcongratulatory science fiction of the matrix  this is a fundamental mindbender for buzz  and the audience shares his humility and wonderment at the sight  \\nhere  as in the roughly concurrent scene where woody watches tapes of the howdy doodyish childrens tv show that originated his character  we see our protagonists come facetoface with god  \\nin sly ways  then  toy story  can be read as a film about mortality  a metaphorical consideration of aging and death  \\nsignificantly  the films very first sequence concludes with a grim shocker that had our openingnight crowd in a nearuproar  \\nand toward the end  when buzz and woody speculate on how long they have before andy grows up and discards his old toys  one of them observes  with an alacrity both inspirational and heartbreaking  that it will be fun while it lasts  \\nso toy story  joins the tradition of childrens stories  largely neglected of late  that say something real about the inevitable joys and tragedies of existence  \\nwhats really striking is that both toy story films  and  to a lesser degree  pixars a bugs life  are kids movies with wit and sophistication to shame most of their ostensibly adult counterparts  not to mention whatever piece of totfriendly eyecandy is due from the disney dream factory any given summer  \\nit puts one in mind of the glory days of chuck jones and the old gang at warner bros  animation  \\nim not sure lasseter and his pals at pixar will ever operate at quite that level of purely visual invention  they love traditional narrative too much  but  boy  it makes me wonder what they might come up with next  \\n directed by john lasseter  colin brady  ash brannon  and lee unkrich written by lasseter  brannon  peter docter  andrew stanton  rita hsaio  doug chamberlain  and

voice in the whole film  when i first saw the trailers   but when i saw the film  i didnt have a problem with her  \\ni take back my insult on driver  \\nits nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature  he was fflewdurr flamm in disneys most underrated classic  the black cauldron   he is funny and delightful as professor porter  \\non the villiany side of the voices  brian blessed  the guy who did boss nass in star wars  episode ithe phantom menace  brings a pompous  and later on vicious  voice to the sinister clayton  \\nhe might not be the strongest character in the film  hes just a plain bad guy  nothing else   but blesseds vocal work contributes greatly  \\nbut if there is any voice that i think steals the whole show  it should be rosie odonnell  who is hilariously funny as terk  \\nshe also has a fiesty attitude   im gonna kill ya   \\nshe says  more than once   \\ni almost sung along with her during one of the films best moments  where the apes make a mess of the humans camp  via song  er  scatting  shoobedoo  dabedah   \\ni can see why she wanted to have a rock song for the film  shes a good singer  \\nnot that she was the only funny character in the film  though  \\nwayne knight  who played stan in space jam  gives a whimsically funny style to tantor  an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into  unsanitary  water  \\n  thankfully  there is no real sound of flatuencethat would have killed the picture   \\nthe songs  as i said before  are decent  mostly sung by collins  \\nthis sets a new standard for disney animated films because for the first time  the characters do not sing  \\ni tolerate musical numbers from characters a lot more than some other guys would  but i found this to be a nice change of pace  \\nthe story does have elements of comedy in it  but they also load it with strong dramatic touches  which makes this film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules  \\nif there is anything disappointing about tarzan  it might be the omission of the n sync version of  trashing the camp  from the film  \\ni heard it on the soundtrack  and wondered where it was going to be  \\ni was upset that it wasnt  because i had thought of taking a few friends of mine who like n sync to see tarzan  \\noh  well    \\noverall  i was enthralled with tarzan  \\ni wouldnt hold it high the way i do with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame  my alltime favorite disney classics   but this film deserves a high place among disneys greatest achievements  \\ni give a nod to disney for following up their spectacular      masterpiece  mulan  with this great animated adaption of egar rice burroughs tarzan  \\n',\n",

for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll  \\nyou see  the trilogy is not just a set of movies  but a religion of sorts to we  the faithful disciples  and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah  \\nunfortunately  it is not our savior  \\nfor weeks beforehand  i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good  stupendously good  miraculously good  \\nanything less and itll be the biggest disappointment of the century  \\ni didnt want the doomsaying prophecy to come true  really i didnt  but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking  \\ncharacter development is virtually nonexistent  \\nwith the possible exception of quigon  most of the films characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions  \\nnone seem very affected by their experiences  and few even show any passion at all  \\ncontrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks  a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo  in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala  \\njar jars life is saved by quigon early in the film  and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh  or supposedly so   \\nhis speech mannerisms are so  cuteified  that i couldnt understand a third of what he was saying  and the slapstick he performed was just distracting  \\nhis head gets caught in an electronic field  his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast  he describes being in trouble as  deep doo doo   and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport  \\ntherein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors  \\nin star wars  we had obiwan telling us mos eisley was a  wretched hive of scum and villainy   \\nin the phantom menace  we get doo doo  \\nthe films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story  a long time ago in a galaxy far  far away      \\nthis film  on the other hand  constantly reminds me that its only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience  \\nperhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition  its kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses   and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy like play by play  \\ni liked the pod race  it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension  but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters  \\nthe race would have been even more exciting without the distraction  \\nthis aspect  coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me  \\ni suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer  but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all  \\ndidnt millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in  over and over again  \\ndidnt the action figures still sell like hotcakes  \\nof course they did  and its only poor judgment that allows the mosteagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults  \\none aspect that will appeal broadly  however  is the use of special effects  \\nthe people at lucass industrial light and magic  the worlds premiere effects house  outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computergenerated images and reallife footage  \\nsome of the scenes have to be seen to be believed  especially the shots of a land battle between the federations robot army and jar jars countrymen  \\nthe space battles are also impressive  although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer  \\nthis  however  is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today  \\njohn williams is back  of course  providing a score for the film as only he can  \\nhis music is pervasive throughout  as rousing and as dramatic as ever  always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately  \\nsince this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nineepisode story  star wars  the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four  five and six  respectively   the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already  in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar  \\nas a result  attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin  \\nit would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obiwan  for example  but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover  it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films  \\none of the new characters is darth maul  hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this films release  \\nin spite of the hype  darth maul is a character which almost didnt have to be in the film  his role is so insignificant  \\nhe has maybe three spoken lines  believe it or not  a second actor voices the character  and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean  \\nwith that working against him  he never has a chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment  \\nlucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe  something which has been prominent throughout  \\nhowever  he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible  offering an easy out for storywriting and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a reallife connection  \\noddly  while trying to capitalize on spirituality  lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little forceloving parasites in your bodys cells  \\nthis only serves to demystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection  \\ndont let me mislead you too far  \\nthe phantom menace  by most standards  is a good film  \\nit contains a lot of visual treats  sets the stage for an epic story  gives us a bit of excitement here and there  and even allows us to revisit some of our old friends  \\nits just that when held up to its predecessors  and to not do so would be unrealistic   this film simply pales

\\naside from joseph gordonlevitt   rd rock from the sun    who gives his strongest performance to date here  none of the actors are that wellknown  but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings  \\nas the main character of kat  julia stiles  last seen in the miniseries  the s   is marvelous and always believable  and certainly has a bright future ahead of her  \\neven though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hardedged  it was easy to identify with kats way of thinking  she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading

life into patrick  and has a lot of chemistry with stiles  \\none other actor of note is larisa oleynik who  with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith  is able to turn bianca into a person with multidimensions  even though she is accurately selfcentered at the onset  \\nin one truthful scene  cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish  and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes  she has  \\none offbeat element of the film  and a source of some hearty laughs  is the way that the schools staff act  which is strikingly unformal  \\nallison janney  as the guidance counselor ms

to the office because  for once  she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good  \\nalthough there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning  most of it actually works  especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters  \\nin one very funny scene  chastity asks   i know people can be overwhelmed  and they can be

once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre  and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the s  \\nit also helps that the movie has a perfectlyassembled soundtrack  mixing indierock with new wave s songs  and with  thank goodness  no rap   \\nby the films end  it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together  and i was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up  especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca  kat and her father  and a flawlesslyacted and moving sequence in

eighties  a decade in which the onejoke comedy rose to an art form  and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept  low result movies  \\nin my mind  the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies  but bad music  bad hair  and bad clothes  \\nmaybe stones after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace  \\nboiler room is an equally welltimed film with some similarities to stones piece of crap  \\nthey both feature a consequential fatherson relationship  though boiler rooms is much more subtle and touching  \\nand they are both concerned with the power of greed  yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slipperysmooth  heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street  \\nboiler room is a message movie as well  though  at least until the end  doesnt shove it in our faces  \\nboiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash  \\nas i said  this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day  bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasnt been seen in quite a while   not only do we want to be millionaires  we want to watch other people become millionaires  \\nin our superjudgmental  poweroriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything  when you have money  you have it  all   \\nand seth  giovanni ribisi  wants it  all  the easy way  \\nhes a wellintentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm  the kind that sells junk stock  whereupon he meets others just like him  \\nben affleck is cast as jim  the company headhunter  who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko  \\nhis job is to influence trainees into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood  \\nits ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b  s that theyre told to dish out to prospective buyers  \\nafflecks character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwins similar character in glengary glen ross  and that proves detrimental to the actors performance  \\naffleck shouts  curses and belittles his rookie employees just like baldwin  minus the edge  \\nwhen alec played the scene he became the part  spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own  \\nby comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading  \\nthe brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks  they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game  \\nrap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are  intellectual gangsters  \\nthey arent above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes  \\nwe drink up this world along with seth  and watch him become seduced by it  just like we might be  \\nas in all cautionary tales  boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing  then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness  \\ni know this story  \\nwe all do  \\nbut it can work if its told with intelligence and energy  and that is how writer  director ben younger tells it  \\nas a director of  please excuse my french  miseenscene younger has much to learn  \\nhis style is sitcom bland  \\nbut his writing isnt  \\nyoungers script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch  his dialogue is like a junior david mamet  \\ndespite the moderate camera work younger fills his phonepitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script  \\nthe brokers  hucksters counter every customer objection  gently bullying them into buying stock  \\nthese moments are filmed like psychological action scenes  a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isnt aware that he is one  \\nwith the exception of afflecks brief appearances  the performances are truly exceptional  \\nribisi  who has the edgy looks of a character actor  is extremely potent here  working his pale angular face  and eerie  plaintive stare for all their worth  \\nhe conveys childlike vulnerability  his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things arent going his way  in some scenes  and in others hes ferociously cut throat  \\nthe jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie  ribisi is confident when its just him and the phone  but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father  authoritatively played by ron rifkin   \\nboiler room thankfully avoids wall streetlike histrionics in the salespitch sequences  the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys  \\nthose ploys are taught to seth by chris  vin diesel   a kind broker who alternates between seths friend and his mentor  \\ndiesl shines in his minor role  \\nthis week i saw the scifi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner  \\nin that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the s  and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the s  \\nnicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he cant have  \\nnia long  as the firms secretary   a lone black women amongst many white men  is ribisis love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets  but develops into something more interesting  \\nthe two make an oddly likeable couple  \\nlong is smart and brash  and ribisi is charmingly aloof  \\nat one point he says to her  im just lookin for some chocolate love   \\nits a terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous childlike way  it becomes sweetly endearing  \\nunfortunately  towards the end  the boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy  \\nthere is much crying  hugging  and sorrowful stares  \\nthis is okay when taken in small doses  but youngers conclusion is constructed as a series of these boohoo moments  one following the other  \\na particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seths manipulations have on one of his poor victims  \\nits not a bad idea but the execution is lacking  with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message  \\nthat message being   greed is bad   \\nyes its patently obvious  but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i havent seen much of in the movies  the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur  \\nand all wall street did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners  \\nboiler room offers neither extreme  \\nit gives us what is in between  and for that i am thankful  \\n',\n",

films  \\nan odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious massmarket commercial sensibilities  this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years  but falls short of actualizing its potential  \\nthough not for lack of trying  \\nin many respects  mulan is among disneys most mature efforts  skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat  \\nthe violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized  the imagery of a pillaged village  neatly encapsulated in the form of a childs discarded doll  is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars  and mulans later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy  bloodless method imaginable  yet how often does a hollywood animated film  long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent  dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner  \\nin an instant  idealistic mulans innocence is lost  and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending  \\nthe film  based upon an ancient chinese fable  centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her familys obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns  cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones  replete with glowing yellow eyes and daggeredged teeth  although lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace   \\ndipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western  european fables and literature for decades  disneys new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere  story intact  to some neutral territory  and revels in its east asian roots  aside from a predominantly asianamerican cast providing the films vocal work  theres liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout  and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence  \\nwhile the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes  invoking pseudoasian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary  and i cant imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors  really  included karatechopping blocks of stone in two  its rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory  \\nthe film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset  although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately  its startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulans land  \\nat its core  the film is a tale of heroic adventure  and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour  perseverance  nobility and courage  \\nas such  animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic  where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work handinhand with visual purity  \\nscenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action  such as mulans venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice  are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation  \\nmulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments  particularly during our heroines characterdefining opening halfhour  \\nits when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation  the friendly animal sidekick  the colourful array of supporting characters  into the mix where it goes slightly awry  \\noff to battle  mulan finds herself being trailed by a jivetalking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little  lucky  cricket  who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audiencefriendly comic relief  \\ntheyre affable presences  and not precisely ineffective  reasonable amounts of humour are elicited  and eddie murphy  who voices mushu  is amusingly earnest  but amidst all the high melodrama  the effect is mildly jarring and  from a storytelling perspective  questionable in its necessity  \\nat training camp  mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits  easily characterized simply as the short clown  the skinny clown  and the big clown   who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness  and  in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns  she grows a certain fondness for a handsome  squarejawed young captain  shang  \\neverybody needs love  even ancient chinese warrior princesses  but not necessarily in  this  film  \\nthe romantic angle  which lets the air out of the sails of the storys neofeminist underpinnings  lacks any genuine spark and plays out like a contractual obligation  \\nanother staple of recent disney animated films  a cache of hummable little ditties  has also obligingly been carried over to mulan but proves to be a decided weakness  \\ncomposed by matthew wilder  none of the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing  and one   ill make a man out of you   unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines   becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable  \\nonly  reflections   an early ballad of lament  proves to be a song of any consequence  serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga  one of musical theatres most wondrously pure voices  \\nnonetheless  mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory  with a strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork  the computergenerated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain is wholly impressive  \\nwhile the blatantly childfriendly

       " 'melvin van peebles  sweet sweetbacks baadasssss song  was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement  \\nit was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident  \\nits violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before  \\nin style  content  and how it was conceived and produced   sweet sweetback  was a cinematic revolution  whether or not one agrees with its subject matter  \\nvan peebles  a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france  built  sweet sweetback  from the ground up almost entirely by himself  \\nbecause no studio would dare fund such a film  he was forced to raise all the money himself  \\nthe movie ended up costing about     part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby  \\nvan peebles cut costs by hiring nonunion labor and taking on most of the films responsibilities himself  \\nhe wrote the script  scored the music  edited and directed the film  as well as starred in the central role  \\nhe was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck  \\nfor instance  when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded xrating  van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa  but he also developed a little marketing scheme  he coined the phrases  rated x by an allwhite jury   which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film  \\nhe also printed the phrase on teeshirts which he had no problem selling  \\nthe storyline in  sweet sweetback  is deceptively simple  \\nit takes place in los angeles  and van peebles stars as the title character  a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel  and makes money by doing what he does best  having sex  \\none day  he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like theyre bringing in suspects on a politicallycharged case involving murder  \\nhowever  on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mumu  hubert scales   who they proceed to beat viciously  \\nacting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation  sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death  \\nthe rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico  \\nalthough the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film  this plot allows van peebles camera to roam the darker side of l  a   the ghettos  alleys  and backstreet whorehouses that other films had always overlooked  \\nvan peebles entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored  \\nat the beginning of  sweet sweetback   he offers this epigraph  which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news   sire  these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented  but a hymn from the mouth of reality     \\nvan peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality  not of exaggeration  \\nof course  with todays abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black innercity life  as well as films by spike lee  john singleton  and the hughes brothers   sweet sweetback  doesnt seem all that revolutionary  \\nit is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made  \\nat that time   sweet sweetback  was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it  \\ndistributors were petrified of a film that  in van peebles words  gave the black audience  a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out  about rising out of the mud and kicking ass   \\nof course  once it caught on  it caught on big  \\n  sweet sweetback  is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era  although van peebles disassociates  sweetback  from other movies like  shaft     and  the mack      because those were financed by big hollywood studios  \\n  sweet sweetback  is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers  \\nhowever  even if when viewed from an africanamerican perspective   sweet sweetback  is certainly not without its controversies  \\nwhen it was first released  an article was published in  ebony  magazine denouncing the film  while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it  \\nthere have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all  beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of  \\nothers have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film  he has no political motivations  and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs  but in personal and selfish motives  \\nstill others point to the clich  black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex  illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm  \\nnevertheless  a movie like  sweet sweetback  cannot be made without conflicting points of view  \\nit is a revolutionary movie not because its about one mans defiance  but because it put frontandcenter black issues that had never been dealt with before  \\nuntil that point  american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain  and with the exception of sidney poitier  all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites  \\nthe fact that  sweet sweetback  was a movie by black about blacks  was something new  in the opening credits  van peebles lists the starring actors as simply  the black community    \\nvan peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between  sweet sweetback  and all movies that had come before it  \\nwhen the movie first opened  he saw it in a theater next to an older woman  \\nnear the end of the film  when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert  she kept saying to herself   oh lord  let him die  \\ndont let them kill him  \\nlet him die on his own   \\nit was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any africanamerican in a movie who rebelled against white authority  that she couldnt even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape  \\nand  of course  sweetback does escape  and the screen fills with the message   watch out  \\na baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues   \\nbeyond the political aspects   sweet sweetback  is an entertaining picture  which van peebles always intended it to be  \\nhe squeezed every drop out of his limited budget  and produced a film that  although dated now  was technically fantastic at the time  \\nhe shot in rough  documentarylike fashion  while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him  \\nhe makes good use of older techniques like split screens  freeze frames  reversed color schemes  and overlapping images  \\nthe only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences  because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment  \\nwatching  sweet sweetback  more than twentyfive years after its initial release  one realizes that it still has bite  \\narguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies  but there are still problems that are reflected in this film  \\nbut there is more to the film than its racial aspect  \\nthe legacy of  sweet sweetbacks baadasssss song  is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the africanamerican perspective  but more importantly  the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him  \\n',\n",

breathtaking looks  \\nyou have to give all of the main actors a healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film  \\nit was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences  \\ni also put much of the blame for the somewhat strained performances in the matrix on the dialogue  which was terrible at times  \\nin more than a few places it got way too existential for my liking and at other times it was just plain weird  \\nit almost seems as though the writers were having a difficult time trying to figure out how to explain the concept for the movie  \\nso they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about  \\nthereby covering up any leaps of faith that they may have had to make in the departments of logic and believability  \\nmy other major complaint with the matrix was with the very unsatisfying ending  \\nthe setup for it was hokey and frankly used in many a bad film before  \\nthe ending itself was just plain strange  \\nthe main reasons to recommend the matrix are the visual

       " 'a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal  \\na soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nationstate against another  \\na common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain  \\na terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end  \\nif the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy  the violence continues  \\nit is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone  even total innocents   anywhere  at anytime that gives the figure his label  \\nedward zwicks the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states  \\nyoud think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines  \\narab terrorists kill american citizens abroad  and the u  s  responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack  \\nhowever  unlike the reallife tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin ladens camp and manufacturing facility  the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal  \\nin retaliation  the terrorists bring the fight to the new world  \\nunwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agentincharge anthony hubbard  denzel washington   who works out of the bureaus new york office at one federal plaza  \\nwhile investigating a series of bombings in the big apple  he encounters cia agent elise kraft  annette bening   also trying to uncover information  \\ngenerally  the fbi is charged with problems inside the u  s   while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm  \\neven spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country  \\nhubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory  but as the two form a tentative professional relationship  hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government  \\nthe original tagline for patriot games was   there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil   \\nhowever true  it was pulled before the movies release because it sounded too much like a dare  \\nrevisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states  the siege is almost an invitation in itself  because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america  \\nadmittedly  the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive  whos going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by twothirds    but the basic premise is still valid  \\ni liked the fact that this film rises above the basic actionthriller fare of good guy gmen against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order  \\nit provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arabamerican population  and that in an effort to find the terrorists  the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself  \\nin fact  about halfway through the film  when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city  the liberties of all americans are put at risk  \\nalthough it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign  the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups  \\nthroughout  the film maintains a conflict between hubbard  who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law  and general devereaux  bruce willis   who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully  \\nwhat results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act  utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides  \\nit actually gets rather heady at times  but its a credit to screenwriters zwick  lawrence wright  and menno meyjes that they dont underestimate the intelligence of the audience  \\ni dont know if its his tone or inflection or something else  but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great  \\nthis  combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the midlevel authority figure  makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable  \\nannette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character ive seen recently  and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable  \\nits somewhat unfortunate that her characters fortitude is broken at a certain point  but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range  \\nbruce willis is pretty much relegated to a toughguy role  always standing straight  and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face  \\nhowever  the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the films development  \\nnotable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad  a lebanese immigrant  \\nthe role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage  and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society  \\ndifficult to say the least  shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch  \\nperhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom  wings   shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night  \\nwhereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwicks favorite actor  he directed washington in glory and courage under fire   james horner seems to be his favorite composer  \\ni therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific scorewriter graeme revell  seven films this year already  over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabianthemed music  and horners record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irishsounding at most  \\nrevell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole  \\nits nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films weve been getting throughout the year  \\nmissteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes  \\nfor example  its pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick  \\nunfortunately  theres a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions  obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eyecatching  \\nin the middle of the city  and against no real opposition   zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than  feet from friendly troops  \\nverisimilitude really goes out the window at that point  \\nthe film also gets a little preachy toward the end  focusing on the ability of different races to get along  \\na noble gesture  the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously  \\nthese flaws are glaring  but they dont detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class  \\n',\n",

it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the everpresent dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years  \\nim happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first  minutes of the film  \\nby that point  it was evident that mr  bond was back with a vengeance  \\nall doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film werent exactly a pleasant experience  \\nit seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts  \\nit took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in  \\ni guess they can be excused though  taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain  \\nanyway  after somebody remembered what the light switch was for  i settled in for bond  \\ni think the most noticeable aspect of this  the th film in the series  is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films  \\nthere were probably more oneliners in this movie than in the last several combined  \\nand bonds last oneliner in the film is about the best of the series  \\nthe world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series  \\neverything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for   \\nfor the most part  the action sequences worked very well  \\nalthough  there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top  even for a bond film  \\ni think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted  \\nwhile he did a good job for the most part  there were points in the movie  specifically during action sequences  that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film  \\nmost noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie  \\nhe almost seemed like he didnt know what he was doing  \\nbut they were brief scenes and really shouldnt take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing  \\nif you have ever seen a bond film  you wont be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit  \\nthe world is not enough is no exception  \\nthis time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world  \\n matches wits with the terrorist renard  robert carlyle   a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain  \\nwhy this point is included is beyond me  \\nthey took great pains to explain his condition  but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought  \\nanyway  renard  like the typical terrorist that he is  is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mideast oil pipeline  \\ni guess world domination just isnt as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore  \\nbond is brought in to protect the pipelines owner  elektra king  sophie marceau   who is the daughter of one of renards recent victims  \\nalong the way  bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist  dr  christmas jones  denise richards   and his old rival valentin zukovsky  robert carlyle   \\nlike all bond films  you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot  since it is ridiculous beyond words  \\nmy biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films  \\nthere was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing  \\nthe buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceaus character  \\nit was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly  although not included in the film  \\nlater  it became a big part of the story

lighter style that brosnan brings to the character  \\njudi dench  as m  had a bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role  \\nshe brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner  \\nrobbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye  so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie  \\ncoltrane gets more screen time  which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes  \\nthen there are the bond girls  \\nsophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today  \\nthere is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim  \\nthose that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face  \\nmarceau may be the most talented actress to ever play a bond love interest  \\nthen we have denise richards  \\nthere was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks  \\nand after you see the outfits she wears  you wont have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producers eyes  \\ni was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did a good job playing a nuclear scientist  \\nadmittedly  there was one point that the audience snickered a bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue  but other than that she stacks up  no pun intended  to her bond girl predecessors nicely  \\ni must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyles character  \\nwhile carlyle did a fine job with the material that he had  his character just never worked for me  \\nthe producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character  but it just never quite got off the ground  \\ni guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character  but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character  \\nthis might have worked well in another movie  but i dont go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations  \\nlast  but not least  we have desmond llewelyn as q  this is the th appearance for llewelyn as bonds gadget guy  and he is as good as ever  \\nalthough his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films  he is still a treat to watch  \\nrumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role  \\nhe says future appearances are up to a higher power  \\nthe producers have introduced his protege and future replacement  a bumbling and somewhat pompous character played by comedy master john cleese  \\nwhile we dont see much of him in this film  i think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyns legacy  whenever it is passed on  will be in very capable hands  \\nso how does it stack up  \\ndespite some problems  the world is not enough is a very entertaining movie

dominates the story  which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background  \\nwere simply dropped in on the characters lives and are expected to figure out the rest  \\nthe characters are a group of middleclass white people who are all successful at what they do  but theyre only concern right now seems to be their sex lives  \\nfirst theres barry  eckhart  and mary  brenneman   a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who dont know what theyre problem is  \\nbarry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife  and the sex they have  but doesnt have a lot of ambition  he just follows everyone else  \\nmary is a writer of some sort  but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character  but ironically  doesnt hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something  \\nlabutes script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals  but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two  \\nobviously  this is the theme  which is enhanced by the actors good performances  but at the same time seems just a bit hollow  \\nanother couple is jerry  stiller  and terri  keener  who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time  yet they constantly argue over anything and everything  \\ntheir sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship  \\nif only one aspect of the film could use improvement  it would be this area  \\nits natural for a married couple to become bored with each other  but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together  \\nwhat did they ever see in the other person to begin with  \\nlabute never really answers  but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process  it still makes for good drama  tension  and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful its fascinating  \\ntwo other characters act as catalysts  cary  jason patric  and cheri  natassja kinski   \\ncary is an arrogant  hostile sexmaniac who defines the word  bastard   \\nsomehow he is able to bend women to his will  either through charm or just attitude  into getting his way  \\nhes the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize hes secretly perverted  but somehow barry finds comfort in his company  although jerry is always nervous around him  \\npatric gives an outstanding performance  so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is  \\ncheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her  \\nshe works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film  each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different  from becoming involved in a relationship with one  to brushing it off as small talk with another  to being outright appalled by yet another  \\nshes a sweet woman  perhaps the most normal of any of the characters  and although her symbolism is obvious  her role as the outsider is the most relatable  \\ni will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others action  as thats the hook of the film  \\nthe first two acts begin to set up the characters and eachs scenarios  but its often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom  \\nthe result is sometimes surprising  other times predictable  but the actual course of actions is always fascinating  \\nfor a while everyone has their fun  but ultimately each characters guilt  attitude  or ignorance will disserve them  \\none of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be  \\nsince the characters only interact with each other there isnt much pop culture references  as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it  \\nare we to assume that these people are  as the title states  our friends and neighbors  \\ni dont know of anyone going through the same situations as these people  \\noften times the film is not unlike a network melodrama  other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie  \\nbut what this film does have that the others dont is repercussions in the end  \\nalthough the film creates its own reality  it goes to show that even the immoral arent immortal  \\nin what way  your friends and neighbors  is supposed to work is open to interpretation  \\nit definitely has a lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity  but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically  \\nstill  its an accomplishment in filmmaking because it has put a timeless theme into a modern perspective  \\n',\n",

wonderfully for one another  \\nits when you have a giant crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends

the highway and onto a frozen lake  where it cracks through the ice and sinks  \\nfourteen children die  and numerous others are hurt  \\nfor the residents of this small town  all of whose children

against someone  anyone for responsibility  \\nthe bus driver  dolores driscoll  gabrielle rose   is a kindly woman who loved the children and  although she lives with a burden of guilt  is not held responsible for the accident  \\nthe bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice  and there was nothing should could do to prevent it  \\nhowever  according to stephens  there are no  accidents  in life  and someone will pay for this tragedy  whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through  \\nhe goes through the town  approaching the parents who have lost children  asking them to join the class action suit and find vent for their anger  \\nand  for his work  stephens will receive onethird of the settlement money  \\nhowever  it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money  \\nhe is driven by something else  something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents  \\nhe has lost a child  too  but not in the same manner  \\nhis daughter  zoe  caerthan banks   who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite  has been in and out of drug rehab clinics and detox stations for ten years  \\nshe calls him on an irregular basis  begging him for money  but refusing to tell him what she needs it for  \\n  i dont know who im taking to   he tells her  \\nin his mind  his daughter is

behind the bus when the accident happened and lost two children  wants nothing to do with it  \\nhe has already lost his wife  and he buries his grief in an affair with a married woman  \\nhe doesnt want to talk about the accident  and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds  \\nto him  the town should be able to take care of its own pain  and it doesnt need outsiders like stephens getting in the way  \\ncentral to  the sweet hereafter  is the tale of nicole burnell  sarah polley   a teenage girl who dreams of being a singer before the accident turned her into  a wheelchair girl   as she puts it  \\naside from stephens  nicole is the most complex character in the film  and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will turn out  \\nit is also her sad  haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack  reading robert brownings poem about the pied piper  and how when he led all the towns children away  one was left behind because he was crippled  \\nobviously  nicole is that child  and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the towns children left her alone by dying in the wreck  \\nher situation is further complicated because she is involved in a loving  but incestuous relationship with her father  tom mccamus   \\nthere is only one  fleeting scene that suggests this relationship  but it is somehow tied into the final act of the film  \\nof all the storylines in  the sweet hereafter   this is the most complicated and unresolved  although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film  \\negoyan knows that the kinds of questions he brings up have no simple answers  if any at all  and he doesnt condescend to the audience by trying to neatly wrap it up  \\nwhat egoyan has done in  the sweet hereafter  is really nothing short of miraculous  \\nin his adaptation of the novel by russell banks  he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss  and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared to human life  \\negoyan has always been a talented  but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold  \\n  the sweet hereafter  is quite the opposite  egoyans stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion  and draw the audience into the tragedy  \\n  the sweet hereafter  seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked  \\nthe film is filled with beautiful  subtle performances from all the actors  especially ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind  \\nthe beautiful  roving camerawork by paul sarossy and the haunting  melodic musical score by mychael danna  both previous egoyan collaborators  give the film a visual and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements  \\nlike his earlier films  egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form a blanketing whole  \\nhe works with time as a fluid substance  shifting back and forth between the past  the distant past  and the present with effortless ease  \\nthe actual bus wreck itself doesnt happen until midway through the film  but by that time the event has built up so much emotion that egoyan can film it from a distance with no graphic detail  and still have it carry great  devastating weight  \\nbecause human life has become such a cheap commodity in movies  it is astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple  direct terms  \\ncertainly one of the best films of    the sweet hereafter  is a deeply rewarding  mystifying  and ultimately human film  \\n',\n",

things upside down  \\n  beloved  acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story  \\nmost of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic  lowlit room  with the occasional flash to the past  where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modernday psychoanalysts  \\nsethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation  which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands  with her nipples being licked  prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it   they took my milk   \\nworst of all was the month after her freedom  when she was allowed to live like a free person  working with other blacks on a farm  and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back  \\nshe runs to the barn near by  carrying her four children  and when her old owners burst in  they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they dont leave them alone  \\nwhen she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film  she says she doesnt regret it  \\nshe killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did  and she has convinced herself she did the right thing  \\nof course  beloved is really her daugher materialized  though we arent flat out told that until later on in the film  \\nbeloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long  \\nthus   beloved  becomes a sortaredux of the andrei tarkofsky scifi classic   solaris   where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife  who commited suicide years before  has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system  \\nthat film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories  how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past  and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us  it would control us completely  \\n  beloved  moves along freely  without a lot of explanation  and for the most part  this is extremely respectable  \\nthe most interesting films are the ones that dont explain everything for us  leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense  \\nsethe is never fully explained as a character  but we understand all her actions since shes being played by oprah winfrey  \\nits been well over a decade since her last major performance in  the color purple   but judging from these two films  ill bet shes one of the best actresses working today    if \\nshe was strictly an actress  \\nher talk show  which i suppose is a great entity  has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress  and thats a shame because she brings so much to this movie  \\nemotion  \\nsadness  \\nstrength  \\nwatching the strong sethe  whos so afraid of the past that shes built a rather strong protective coating around herself  break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great  \\nshe makes it real  \\nthats not to say this is a perfect film  \\nin fact  id wager to say that the fact that its confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is  \\nwhile oprahs performance is powerful and easily sympathetic  and im dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february   the structure of the film  which doesnt show what happened to her children till halfway through the film  prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the film  \\nit doesnt necessarily move as though theyre memories of one particular character  and by the end  it has lost control over sethe  and as she takes to bed  we are unable to truly identify with her anymore  \\nbut despite its tediousness  perhaps thats the point  \\nthe distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start  since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable  and it needs to get back with reality  \\nand for the most part  this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be  \\njonathan demmes direction is bizarre  in nature with the story  and he creates the right mood  making it a tough film to sit through  making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters  \\ntheres more to admire here  like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization  just like they would be in real life  and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering  but laced with a touch of optimism  \\nthe acting  not only from winfrey  is amazing  and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination  \\neveryone has been raving about thandie newtons performance  and how it should be rewarded  \\nhowever  it must be noted that out of everyone  she had the easiest part  \\nact like a baby  \\nthrow things  \\nstumble around  \\nchew food with your mouth open  \\ni do think theres another performance worthy of oscar conisderation  but its kimberly elise  as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane  and has to carry the burden of her mothers loss of reality towards the end  \\nits not that newton isnt great  shes as annoying and wacky as the role demands  \\nits just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better  \\ndespite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it  and not that of writer morrison or director demme   beloved  has still not done well  \\ncosting  i think  around ninety million dollars  it has since grossed about twentytwo  \\nunfortunately  this film is a little too intense for viewers  even for me  and i can stand almost anything  i recently viewed the   hour long epic  caligula   the worst film i have ever seen in my life  and did it in a mere  sittings   \\nalthough i respect  beloved   i cant say that i really enjoyed it  \\n',\n",

mouse detective and oliver and company  although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron  didnt do much better  although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective   \\nonly with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features  \\nas for the black cauldron  it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron  \\nfinally  the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released  \\nbecause of all this  you might ask yourself  was the black cauldron really such a bad movie  \\nthe people who had seen the film didnt think so  \\nin fact  many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film  but of course  they denied it  \\nfor a while  it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video  until september   disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom  \\nfew people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc  including me  and for those who hadnt seen the film yet  i am included here   they got quite a treat  \\nbut people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors  about  seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating  in the uk  the u rating means universal  suitable for all ages  kinda like their own version of g   \\nsomewhere online  a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said  bring back the black cauldron    and because of that  disney finally decided to release the video to the united states  \\nbefore that time  rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed  like the uk video  so that it would get a g rating  and that they would add in songs  \\nthose rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron  would  be released in its pg rated version  \\neven still  when it was finally released to the us  some reaction was mixed  \\nsome felt that it was indeed cut  but some felt that it wasnt  \\nbut these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable  since a film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available  \\nas for myself  when i saw the movie for the first time  on converted ntsc video   i didnt expect much at all  \\nin fact  i had heard so many mediocre things about it  that i didnt think the film would ever be such a good film  \\nmuch to my surprise  when i saw the first few minutes of the film  i was asking myself   this is the same film everyone saw  \\nthe one that flopped at the box office  \\nthe one that critics and filmgoers alike called  a bad movie   \\nthis doesnt seem like all of the above  \\ninstead  its a classic in its own right  \\nthe film has a wonderful cast of characters  \\ntheres taran  grant bardsley   an assistant pig keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pigkeeper  the storys hero  \\nthe critics have said that taran is not likeable at all  but the opposite is true  \\nhe is brave  loyal  and eventually learns a lesson about friendship later on  \\ntheres a likeable character here  \\nnot that hes the only likeable character in the film  \\ntheres gurgi  john biner   a lovable little  uh  thing who remains loyal to taran  even though they dont quite hit it off at first  \\nbut another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman  a dwarf named creeper  phil fondacairo   who is loyal to the films imaginative and sinister villain  the horned king  voiced gruesomely by john hurt   yet he also fears his neck  \\nthe other characters  including the sidekicks  a spunky  but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm  and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret  although pleasant and likeable  arent quite as well rounded as they should be  \\nthe story itself is an adventurous one  a quest involving the mystical pig  hen wen  the black cauldron itself  and an army of deathless ones with everything  a hooking opening to a spectacular finale  \\nelmer bernsteins music also tells the story perfectly  in a dark  yet calming manner  \\nthe animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios  \\neven though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good  like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth  the animation overall is top notch  \\noverall  this film is an entertaining endeavor  \\nfans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get a kick out of this one  except young kids  \\nthere are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disneys other films  although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary   which is the main reason why this film is rated pg  \\nfans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie  \\neven though it doesnt have all of the ingredients of a true disney film  this film is a classic in its own right  and deserves a far better chance than what it has been given  \\nthat better chance has finally come  \\nwhatever reason about why the black cauldron was such a big failure seems to have disappeared  and the film has finally achieved its place among disneys most proudest achievements  \\ni cant help but think though  whatever would have happened if the black cauldron  was  a box office success  \\n',\n",

on that kind of financial  technical  and creative responsibility singlehandedly  and its testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall  \\nand  thankfully  every bit of that

clear  \\nin a recent article in  newsweek   he wrote   filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such a strong emphasis on the holy spirit  and when they do  it tends to be patronizing  full of charlatans and snake handlers    \\nbut what i really wanted to do was try to understand what these preachers go through and what they believe  and to portray it in an accurate way   \\nthe strength of duvalls convictions turn out to be the strength of his film   the apostle  always rings true  even in the most painful moments  because we know hes being sincere with the subject matter  \\nafter fifteen years of traveling the country  listening to all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking studious notes on what they said  duvall has captured the energy and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual  \\nhis sonny is a man who speaks directly to god and expects to be spoken right back to  \\n  ive always called you jesus and youve always called me sonny   he says  \\nwhen neighbors call and complain that he is being too loud one night in one his rants with the man upstairs  sonnys mother  june carter cash  just hangs up on them because she knows theres no sense trying to interrupt him  \\nthe main theme to emerge from  the apostle  is the fact that good can come from any situation  \\nsonnys act of violence toward another human being is inarguably a horrific thing  and duvall never shrinks from that fact  \\nhowever  that very same act of violence is what brings sonny to bayou boutte  where he finds people whom he desperately needs and who desperately need him  \\nin his short time in louisiana  he does a world of good  and when the police finally show up to take him away  he goes quietly  knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him  \\nand  as a scene during the final credits shows  he even turns his punishment into a positive opportunity for change and betterment  \\nit is that strength in sonnys character that makes him so appealing and magnetic to others  he is flawed  but he is powerful enough to overcome those flaws  \\nweak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses and lack the desire to better themselves  \\nwatching duvall onscreen  its not hard to imagine that he would have been a magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting  \\nas sonny  he completely inhabits the character  and his performance is certainly the best of the year  \\nbecause he spent so much time absorbing the traits  methods  quirks  and personalities of real preachers  duvall was able to create a complete character who always feels indelibly human  \\nas a director  duvall feels that less is more  \\nhis camera simply takes in what goes on in front of it  with very little intrusion  \\nthere are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or excessive closeups  \\nduvall knew that the power of the films characters  enhanced by the fact that he cast mostly nonprofessional churchgoers and actual ministers  didnt need to be artificially enhanced  \\nin this way   the apostle  almost plays out like a documentary  not only in its technical simplicity  but more importantly  in its sense of reality  \\n',\n",

term to describe rickmans feature debut as a director  the winter guest  \\nthe film has a simple  unhurried rhythm that uses all of the available elements to fashion a successful whole  \\nthe result is an occasionally haunting  sometimes magical  and always insightful human drama  \\nthe winter guest isnt about resolving plot threads and advancing a story line  its about exploring relationships and examining life in all of its stages  \\nthe winter guest does not tell a traditional tale  nor does it ascribe to a conventional narrative structure  there is no real beginning or end  \\ninstead  we are given an opportunity to observe one day in the lives of eight humans  \\nthey represent both sexes  multiple generations  and a variety of relationships  male and female  young  middleaged  and

of the year  \\nits so frigid that the sea has begun to freeze over  \\nthe onshore wind cuts like a knife and snow blankets the beach  giving the terrain an alien appearance  \\nit is against this backdrop that the relationships of the film are captured  \\nthere are four pairings  and  although there is some interaction between the different twosomes  the winter guests focus is on the dynamics internal to each relationship  \\nthe first  meatiest pairing is that of elspeth  phylida law  and her recentlywidowed daughter  frances  emma thompson   \\nthese two have a stormy relationship  \\nthey love each other deeply  but both are stubborn and willful  and neither is willing to admit that they need the other  \\nmuch of their interaction is argumentative  but  during the course of a

sort of goofy  lighthearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight  but little more  id frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often  \\nit was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friends wedding was such a success  a strong  bouyant romanticcomedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects  featuring a triumphant performance from ms  roberts  \\nthe heroine of my best friends wedding is julianne potter  julia roberts   a successful new york restaurant critic  and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes  rupert everett  that years ago  she had made a pact with her dear best friend and exlover michael oneal  dermot mulroney   a sports writer  that if they both hadnt married by the time they reached   they had promised to marry each other  \\nboth julianne and michael are both single  of course  and when george inquires about michaels age  julianne realizes that hes mere weeks away from his th birthday  and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day  \\nhowever  she finds herself even more distraught when michaels call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace  cameron diaz   and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding  julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael  and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary  \\nthe setup for my best friends wedding  then  is a fairly conventional one  and in many ways the films storyline is formulaic  but only to a certain extent  the film was directed by p  j  hogan  whose first feature  muriels wedding  had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting uglyduckling story  and the same holds true for my best friends wedding  which confidently combines traditional romanticcomedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour  \\nthe film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr  hogan  \\nfor example  theres a heartfelt  emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film  with a trio of teenagers  inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks  harmonizing in the background  \\nmy best friends wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film  and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect  it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allens everyone says i love you  id even assert its a more successful one  \\nmy best friends wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well  \\nin a typical romanticcomedy  kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty  conniving ice queen  and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps  this film is smarter than that  here  kimmy is sweet  sincere  and innocent  julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmys life  shed actually like her too  \\nthe george character is almost a staple of recent film  the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason  but in my best friends wedding  he gets to have a playful  mischievous and charming personality  \\nthroughout the film  the formulaisms one often sees is romanticcomedy are given little twists  and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion  \\nthere is a lot of smart writing in the wellpaced screenplay by ronald bass  were given four interesting  vivid  and likeable characters  with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments  \\nmy best friends wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts  who turns in a topnotch  confident and reassured performance as julianne  \\nthis isnt the sort of role one usually associates with ms  roberts  the julianne characters neurotic  fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role  but ms  roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here  remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience  if not entirely sympathetic  even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable  \\neven better than ms  roberts though is cameron diaz  who turns in a shining performance in my best friends weddding  \\nwith a smile which lights up the screen  she effectively conveys kimmys insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner  and never hits a false note in the film  \\nshe even sings  i wont soon forget her charming serenade of  i just dont know what to do with myself   \\nrupert everett is given a very juicy role as george  and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film  \\nhis george is a bit of a devilish rogue  entirely affable  and mr  everetts performance is a delight to watch  hes clearly having fun  and his joy is infectuous  \\ndermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role  unlike the other characters in the film  hes not given a lot to do  but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms  roberts and mr  mulroney  and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic  \\nwhen julia roberts lustre began to fade  and she was usurped from her title as  americas sweetheart  by sandra bullock  i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile  \\nwhile that didnt quite work out  its nearcertain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in   the romanticcomedy  will once again raise her

       " 'cinema has been around for about a hundred years now   \\nits not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film  but id like to think that im beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time  \\nrecently  ive seen the films of hitchcock  capra  fellini  godard  kurosawa  chaplin  lang  and many others  \\n  those men were talented artists  and their films reflect their genius   \\nthey are likely to be remembered for  \\n  \\n  \\nwell  quite a while   \\ni like this film  too   \\nyes  its a disasterslashaction movie   \\ntrue  its budget is a lot more money than ill ever see in my lifetime   \\nand theres not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money   \\nin fact  i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film  had they thought it wouldve been more profitable  \\ni certainly dont care what their intentions were  because michael bay  the rock  is such a skilled director that i doubt hed ever make a film that is difficult to sit through  \\nof course  skillful direction doesnt complete the package  but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together  \\nthe story is wellthought out  and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place   the acting is terrific  the script is sharp  and  get this  there are characters  \\nyes  you read that right  \\narmageddon actually has characters you can care about  \\nif you dont like this film  then you have a problem with the genre itself  armageddon is as good as a film like this can be  \\nif youve seen deep impact  then you know the basic framework for the story  \\nit turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film  \\nso  its up to the u  s  government to stop it  \\n  why the u  s  is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated   \\ntheir plan  to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid  drill down several hundred feet  and detonate a nuclear warhead within  \\nthe head driller is harry stamper  bruce willis   \\nhis group of men is a colorful bunch  including a  j  \\n  ben affleck   chick  will patton   and rockhound  steve buscemi   \\ntheres also an interesting triangle formed between a  j   harry  and grace  liv tyler   who is harrys daughter  \\na  j  \\nand grace are  of course  romantically intertwined  and dad isnt too happy with the situation  \\nits absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is youd like to call armageddon  \\nits not about story  its about viscera and action  and thrillsaminute  and all that stuff  \\nits incidental  really  that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable  because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds thought to what actually happens  \\nbut bay is the one to congratulate in this case  for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better  \\ni think most of the budget went to cameras alone  because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles  \\ntake the spectacular opening scene  for instance  in which a meteor shower obliterates new york  \\na meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building  which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars  \\nthe action itself might take five seconds in real life  but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways  \\ni like his quickedit style  because its abrasive and exhausting to watch  \\nits also very loud  and obnoxiously noisy at times  \\nbut its fun to be obnoxious sometimes  \\nthe special effects in this film put every other  blockbuster to shame  \\ndeep impact  visually  has absolutely nothing on armageddon  and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable  \\nspecial effects are very important in a film like this  if theyre not good  then the image is not convincing  and the film doesnt work  \\neverything here looks bright and explosive  from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers  all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid  \\nthe effects that dont look totally real are still a pleasure to behold  and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nicelooking that it actually qualifies as art  \\nof course  all of this would add up to little more than an aboveaverage light show  if i didnt get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action  \\nthe film is two and a half hours long  and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action  \\nmuch of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters subplots  \\ni wont suggest that these are complex characters  but their problems are real  and the emotions arent put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way  \\nin fact  there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up  and thats a lot more than i can say about deep impact  which was banking on the feelgood parts of its story  \\nbruce willis is terrific  and im glad to see him bigger than life again  recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing   \\ntyler and affleck are great together  and make a convincing couple  all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level  \\npatton  who is a magnificent actor  thankfully is not wasted here  and the minor subplot revolving around his exwife and son is very moving  \\nthe comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare  who plays a crazy russian astronaut  is nifty  and keeps the film lively and funny  \\ni wasnt challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon  and i dont mind too much  \\nbut the film doesnt insult my intelligence  its pitched perfectly to entertain  which is what all it really wants to do  \\nits not mindless and escapist  but wellcrafted cinema  \\nit might have been created for the wrong reasons  but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good  in spite of the producers and the budget  \\nim not saying that films like this are risky moves  \\nwhat i am saying is that armageddon is a big  loud  expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms  \\n',\n",

       " '  the faculty   the heavilyhyped and advertised scifihorror film that has teamed up director robert rodriguez  s  desperado  and s  from dusk till dawn   and screenwriter kevin williamson  s  scream  and s  scream     is being called a cross between  invasion of the body snatchers  and  the breakfast club   and i dont think i could describe it any better than that  \\nthe film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common  and then the sciencefiction aspect is added  involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town  \\nthe six characters  as in  the breakfast club   can be easily labeled as a stereotype  but as they are developed  they become far more complex  casey  elijah wood   the much picked upon nerd  stokely  clea duvall   a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her  zeke  josh hartnett   a drug dealer who turns out to be a science whiz  stan  shawn hatosy   the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics  delilah  jordanna brewster   the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist  and marybeth  laura harris   the sweet n southern new girl in town  \\nalthough the characters are only slightly connected  i  e  \\ncasey is delilahs photojournalist assistant  marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely  since they both dont have friends  etc    when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences  the only people they can count on for help is each other  even though they arent really even sure if they can trust one another  \\n  the faculty  is another smart and popculturally hip film from williamson  although it does not equal up to his best film  the original  scream   and rodriguez  whose  from dusk till dawn  is still one of the more original genre films of the s  \\nwilliamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions  respectively  that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a nobrainer  \\nthe plotline of  the faculty   involving aliens taking over other peoples bodies  has been done quite a lot before  from  invasion of the body snatchers   to  the puppet masters   to  invaders from mars   so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh  and by setting the goingson at a high school and having the protagonists be a group of teens  they were mostly successful  \\nsurely  the conventions of the story are still the same  and the climax was inevitable  but there were a few surprises along the way  including the question of who were the aliens  and who werent  \\nthe epilogue was also a refreshing changeofpace as it did not set up a sequel but ended on a note that probably could not have been any better  \\nthe performances in  the faculty  were a treat throughout  since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do  \\none exception were the teens  who  aside from elijah wood  are not very wellknown  but they all aquit themselves nicely  particularly wood  the seasoned pro   clea duvall  and jordanna brewster  \\nas members of the faculty  robert patrick   t  judgement day   was creepy as the gym coach  piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher  bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien  and salma hayek  as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold  was very funny in a small role  \\nthe standout  in my opinion  of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who  after turning into an alien  becomes the sex bombshell  \\nif there was any problem i had with the faculty  it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence  \\nsince the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the  queen  alien  many of the faculty members disappear  \\nit might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers  although the finale is still pretty impressive  and includes some showstopping creature effects  especially for a relatively low milliondollar budget  \\nalthough not one of the best horror or sciencefiction films i have seen   the faculty  is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released  \\nwhile the story is as old as the hills  it is also  in a way  timeless  because everyone  i think  has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did not act right  as if they really werent human  \\nand by putting this idea in the setting of a smalltown high school  it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers  \\n note  the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading  as it features r  b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters  \\nin actuality  he only has a small

part of each others story  not necessarily an important or even significant part  but a part nevertheless   \\nthat seems to be the basic theory behind go   where several characters chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways  \\nin order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldnt usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them  such as a teenage supermarket cashier  a bottomofthedrugfoodchain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors  \\nthese types of characters might not sound all that original  but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father  a midlevel drug dealer  a narc obsessed with multilevelmarketing  horny wedding guests  a zen lovemaker  two shrimpscarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out  \\nhow they will all come together is the process the film deals with  \\nid imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general  \\nthe film starts out as anything else  with little indication of whats to come  \\nwe meet ronna  polley   a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesnt seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent  \\nshes not very charming  especially to her customers  but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works  \\nmaybe this is because shes not a very afeminite character  but shes far from masculine  a creative character indeed  \\nthings start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy  hyperactive  yet likable simon  askew   an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences  \\nthis agreement starts a threepronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug  \\nthe process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death  \\nnearly the same can be said for two other characters  zack  mohr  and adam  wolf   who we dont think much of when they first appear as supporting characters  but later will become major players to the films makeup  another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be  \\nonce the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle  \\nwhen the title screen ronna is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene  its clear this film isnt going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling  \\nconsidering how good it is up until that point  its a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today  \\nand so the film begins to take shape  first by following ronna and her friends on a onenight adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam  who were actually looking for simon   which doesnt exactly go as planned  but thats what keeps it all so interesting  \\nthe second storyline starts at the same moment as ronnas story  but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead  \\nsimon and his three friends head to  vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined  \\nthe third arc  about zack and adam  again overlaps with ronnas story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle  \\nwere shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna  \\nand many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam arent even their fault  they just happened to be where they were when they were  \\nid really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end  but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who havent seen the film  \\nperhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability  and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay  just through great filmmaking  \\nstill  i can list and analyze nearly everything the film does so well  \\n  direction  trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such as liman  its a great accomplishment  \\nhe doesnt just depict a story  he wraps us up in it all  pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high and low  \\n  screenplay  besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general  its clear the script has been inspired by many sources  with both obvious and subtle references  yet it never screams ripoff   \\n  tonemood  where other hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of the independents to the mainstream  this one is able to create its own sense of the macabre  \\nits not overlydark or twisted and the comedy isnt so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy  more like macabre light   \\n  cinematographyart direction  able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner  \\n  characterization  for nearly every character introduced  no matter what role they play in the big picture  were able to get a sense of who they are  what theyre thinking and how they came to be in their situations  \\neven when their actions are surprising  it never seems very out of synch  \\n  performances  every actor nails their role  see above   \\n  themetheory  the film doesnt seem to be concerned with conveying any

\\nrobert forster and michael keaton are solid in their toughguyswhorarely smile roles  \\nbridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons  to look sexy in a bikini  to provide a little twisted comedy  and to satisfy tarantinos foot fetish  \\nrobert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy looking  middleaged actor  \\nthe film  which clocks in at several minutes over the twoanda half hour mark  is probably too long for the material  but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout  although the payoff is a letdown   \\ntarantino keeps things moving along nicely  with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction  but  on the whole  this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself  \\nwhen it comes to recent caper films  like the grifters and bound   jackie brown is a secondtier effort  \\nits an entertaining diversion  but not a masterpiece  and certainly not an oscar contender  \\n',\n",
       " 'one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable  \\nyou know  the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information  and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is  \\nsure  its been used over and over  but for some reason  it is always fun to watch  \\nthis cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on  overused  but always fun  \\none of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is  but how it goes around giving its story  \\nthis rule applies highly to kiss the girls  \\nthere is something psychologically stimulating in a wellcrafted serial killer movie  and kiss the girls is certainly well made  \\nhowever  the whole film screams of unoriginality  and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through  \\nwell  not only are the actors capable of pulling it through  but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up  \\nunfortunately  one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers  one that seven  a film a lot like this one  knew not to make  was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits  \\nthat may give the actor credit for the role  but throughout the film  hidden in my mind  i was waiting for him to appear on screen  which spoiled the mystery  \\nhowever  credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film  \\nplotwise  kiss the girls shows almost no originality  \\nwe are introduced to detective alex cross  morgan freeman   a forensic psychologist  and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero  \\nhe gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself  \\nobviously cross succeeds at getting the gun  but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene  \\nat his house  cross is told that his neice  naomi  gina ravera   has been missing for four days  \\nthis provides the motivation for cross to find the killer  but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two  and as a result  we cant sympathize with detective cross  \\nhowever  what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees    \\nbefore she is abducted  \\ndr  kate mctiernan  ashley judd  the actress of the judd family  is a smart  athletic woman  and because of these traits  becomes a target for casanovawhat the serial killer likes to call himself  \\nbecause of these characterdeveloping scenes  we care for mctiernan  making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful  \\nafter being abducted  mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods  \\nremembering that the killer gave her certain rules  she decides to break one of them by calling out  \\nwhen casanova comes to punish her  she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall  \\nafter she is found  she begins to help cross find his neice  \\nfrom this moment on  kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film  as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive  \\nmany people will compare this film to s seven  another killer film starring morgan freeman  but i presume that the similarities are intentional  \\nthe screenplay  by david klass  is adapted from the novel written by james patterson  and yet i dont quite see how this story could have worked in novel form  \\nwhat makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness  \\nthe cinematography  by aaron schneider  is reminiscient of seven  and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us  \\nsometimes a simple shot is the best one  \\nhowever  many of the shots are stunning  and unlike seven  most of them take place during the day  in sunlight  \\nthe scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done  in more than one way  \\nthe camera work is terrific  but the editing makes this scene work so well  \\nthe chaotic and mtvtype cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness  exactly what judds character is experiencing  \\nhowever  the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors  \\nmorgan freeman is one of todays most powerful and believable actors  \\ndetective cross is a very good character for him  although it is just a similar one to the character in seven  \\nbecause of freemans powerful presence  he carries half the film by himself  \\nthe other half is carried by ashley judd  one of todays most promising dramatic actresses  \\nin fact  her performance is better than freemans  if that is even possible  \\nher character is more original than freemans  and she handles it wonderfully  \\nwe finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream  \\nthe supporting cast is highly underdeveloped  but the cast members do as much as they can with it  \\ncary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina  and unfortunately has scraps for a character  \\ntony goldwyn fairs slightly better  but we dont really get to know his character either  \\ngina ravera gives a good performance  but again she isnt in many of the scenes  \\nso as a result of all these small supporting parts  the weight of the film lies on the two leads  and they do a phenomenal job  \\nsome of the best acting of this genre  and some of the best acting of the year  \\ntwo other essential aspects of the film are quite good  \\ndirector gary fleder does a good job of controlling his actors  but the second half of the film loses believability  especially during the revelation of the killer  \\nhe also doesnt handle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would have  losing a lot of tension during many scenes  \\nhowever  to his credit  he does manage a terrific first half  \\npart of the blame falls on david klass  \\nim sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more  but klass focuses on the two main parts  \\nwhile this may give the two leads more screentime  many of the small characters are onedimensional  and the killer  when revealed  is extremely implausible  \\nthanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel  kiss the girls always seems intelligent  \\nnone of the conversations are laughable  and all move the plot forward without seeming forced  \\none of the biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer  \\ni blame this mainly on the casting director  because the killers motive is because of rejection from women  or so i assume from the opening monologue   but the killer himself is very attractive  one of my friends is a  shall we say  big admirer of the killer   \\nkiss the girls is rated r for terror  violence  language  and suggested sex  \\nwith all the implausibilities of this film  and with the mediocre second half  kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain  \\nin fact  i had the urge to see it again just for the performances  \\nthe cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone  and the script is usually smart  \\nthis is clearly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through  \\nmorgan freeman is possibly todays most convincing actor  and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt  \\ni must also say that i loved the ending  \\nthe showdown between good and evil was quite tense  and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer  \\nperhaps it may not be possible  but most of the film isnt anyway  \\n',\n",

sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception  \\ndespite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film  it remains foremost a finelycrafted piece of entertainment  constantly light and accessible  \\nthe tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude  and as the carefullystacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down  the film eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false  \\nthe end act of the truman show essentially boils down to a rehash of the reliable  crowdpleasing underdog vs  \\nthe system formula  \\nwhile the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept  some elements are lacking  \\nthe device of mysterious laurensylvia  natascha mcelhone  as a contributing impetus to trumans growing awareness isnt exactly convincing  \\ntheres not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves  and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff  ed harris  with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience  thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film  \\nin fact  although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside trumans artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers  it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even  more  deeply in the insulatory seahaven world  with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling  \\nstill  the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target  and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright antivoyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city  \\nive always believed that the versatile ms  linney possesses a tremendous comic gift  she has always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes  and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character  mischievously flashing a glazed  insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans  \\ncheerfully going over the top  its hilarious to watch her  who would have ever guessed that shed have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of a film  \\nms  linney is a delight in the film  \\nbut it is mr  carrey who rules the show here  \\nhe may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank  the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts  but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal  its difficult not to root for truman  \\nin a commanding performance  mr  carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him a genuinely engaging presence  and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn  demonstrating admirable restraint  theres an early scene where hes down on his knees gardening  and given his past track record  one almost instinctively anticipates mr  carrey to pull one of more infamous  and in this case  wholly inappropriate sight gags  \\nits almost poetic how this notorious lookatme actor successfully tones it down to play a character whos constantly the centre of attention  \\nin addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast  mr  emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness  the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating trumans antiseptic  white picketfenced smalltown utopia  and by burkhard dallwitzs original score  \\ntechnical credits are firstrate all around  \\nwhile the truman show is clearly a definitive highconcept film  its not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one  obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound  ranging from s secret agent through to the groundbreaking british  tv series the prisoner  \\nall the same  this is a visionary  awardcalibre film  entertaining  provocative  and intelligent  \\nthe curious  and possibly disturbing  thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the films concept seems unfathomably outrageous  its abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching  if not actualisation  at least permissiveness of such a scenario  \\nperhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to mr  weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question  \\nperhaps we recognize a bit of ourselves in this world  \\n',\n",

most enjoy  \\nsome scoff the idea  but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next  revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before  \\nthis can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole  on the surface  it appears to be a light  fluffy fable with no depth or true worth  but when one takes a second  deeper look  chocolats true colors begin to shine through  \\nmaking a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it  lasse hallstroms chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously craftednot to mention one of the best films of the year  \\nwhat gives chocolat its magic  much like hallstroms  winner of two academy awards  the cider house rules  is its willingness to say whats on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences  \\nthe bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers  but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrowmindedness  \\nchocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet  where majority rules  and the majority lives by only one law  religion  \\nthe bulk of the townspeople  with few exceptions  are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence  lent  but when the independent thinking  seemingly nonreligious vianne rocher  juliette binoche  and her daughter anouk  victoire thivisol  make the

of the chocolate shop just in time for lent  especially the mayor  comte de reynaud  a cartoonlike alfred molina   who will stop at nothing to put her out of business  \\non the other hand  the shop is a delight to others  including the cranky armande voizin  judi dench   who sits day by day in viannes shop  telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson  aurelien parentkoening   which comes as a result of his mother  carrieann moss  believing armande is a bad influence  as she does not hold the same  strict religious beliefs that she does  \\nalso a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat  whose husband is constantly beating her  to whom vianne offers a home and befriends  \\njuliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne  genuinely capturing her characters determination to turn the narrowminded townspeople into more happy  independent human beings  but most of chocolats success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses  \\nlena olin  previously nominated for an oscar in   deserves her second nomination for her earnest  moving portrayal of a lost  scared woman torn between staying true to her battering  manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs  \\njudi dench is sharp  incisive  and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin  \\ncarrie annmoss  in what is likely to be her first largely noticed  and acclaimed  role since the matrix  shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen  crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously  \\nvictoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk  a young girl hoping her alwaysonthemove mother will eventually settle down  \\na trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline   five extraordinary women  one extraordinary movie   \\nthats not to say the men dont do their share  though  alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist  hugh oconor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is  and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux  who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne  \\nthe technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board  lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care  perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film  \\ncinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric  fairy tale look to the film  and rachel portmans masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules  \\nchocolat  adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel  is a wonderful little treat of a film  one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter  and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter  \\nwhile not as powerful as the cider house rules  lasse hallstroms chocolat is a film which works on all levelsas a drama  a comedy  a fable  a romance  and a fairy tale  \\nand it even lives up to its name  it is delicious to savor the taste of  easy to digest  and  like all excellent chocolate  it is memorable for days afterward  \\nthe bottom line  chocolat is pure pleasure  \\n',\n",

an older man  played by john mahoney  to become a bigtime bowling hustler  \\nit was parody at its finest  more of which showed up in the shortlived  the ben stiller show  on the fox network in late early   \\nlike  the critic   which aired on abc  then fox   i still mourn that shows cancellation  \\ncameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film  although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates  and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paperthin at times  \\nhowever  diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm  that you can still see why shes got guys just falling over each other to be with her  \\nheck  i even found her laugh to be cute  even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week  \\nmy girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesnt change  and you know  its really true  \\nhe and ralph macchio must hang out or something  \\nmaybe they live in dick clarks pool house  \\nanyway  heres another good piece of casting  as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into marys heart  \\nthe supporting performances are also good  \\nchris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss  yes  check it out next time   and less annoying than in cabin boy  \\nlin shae  who plays marys neighbor magda  and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin   provides some good laughs  especially in scenes with her benjilike dog  which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film  \\nlee evans  as marys friend tucker  displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist  \\nthe farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j  strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there arent any noticeable times where the film drags  \\nthe only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes  \\nthey appear out of nowhere and actually sing plotrelevant information right toward the camera  \\nits a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film  \\nafter that it got a little annoying  and its unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow  \\nfortunately  filled with sight gags  humorous lines  and solid comedic acting  theres something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater  \\n',\n",
       " 'plot  a young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster in london and quickly becomes a staple by his side  \\nbut this new guy is not like all the others  hes got ambition  hes got goals and he loves everything he sees about being the number one gangster  \\nviolence  lots of swearing and betrayals ensue  \\ncritique  a very good  seriousminded  unique british gangster flick which misses the  great  mark by way of an annoying voiceover popping up throughout the film and a soso ending  \\nheres yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix  \\nokay  so its not entirely new  but its definitely original when all put together as done here  \\nthe thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place  \\nits  and these dudes are looking good  \\nyes  its all about the suits  fellas    the \\nitalian shoes  the cufflinks  the ties and the birds  thats ladies  for those uninitiated  hanging around you  \\nhere are a bunch of horrible men  gangsters if you will  looking sharp  talking shit and busting heads all over the place  \\nbut thats not the basis of this movie  \\nthe basis of this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group  the excellent david thewlis  and one of his cronies  paul bettany  also extremely good in this film  and how the power  sex appeal and coolness of one  affects the other  \\nyou know how there are always these  hangeron  gangster types who latch on to the godfathers  the leaders  the top dogs of every crime organization  \\nwell  most of the time  these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person    that \\nis  their boss  \\nso all the gangster number one needs to worry about is his enemies on the other side of the fence  \\nbut this film brings the betrayals  the messed up loyalties  the honor codes among bad guys into play within the same group and presents it in quite the stylistic package  \\nof course  director paul mcguigan isnt trying to be guy ritchie here  and doesnt overstylize his presentation  jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix  \\nnope  he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this  \\nthe first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which hes attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty  \\n   look into my eyes    \\nin fact  the last time that ive seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brothers millers crossing  \\nscary shite  \\nbut theres an ever better scene than that in this film  \\nthis one features bettany  once again  slowly torturing  hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster  from that mans pointofview   but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes  one by one  thats right  he  does  the guy in his underwear   \\nthat scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film  especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss  why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman    \\nbut the flicks not perfect  \\nin fact  i didnt mind malcolm mcdowells voiceover narration at first  but as the film grew into a major flashback  most of the film is presented as such   he came in every now and then  and rarely added anything of interest to the plot  \\nall he seemed to do was swear and call people the cword umpteen times  and even described one scene as it was happening      so \\ni opened the door  then went up the lift  etc      its \\nlike  yeah  i know that already  i could see it on the screen   \\noverdone    \\ni also didnt quite  buy  the ending of the movie  which despite being original  seemed a little unbelievable  especially when you consider that its supposed to be taking place  years later  and folks still seem to be holding grudges  still in love  still living in the same apartments     \\ni mean  cmon    its  years  man   \\ni dont know  somehow it didnt work all that well for me  \\nbut one of my favorite genres has always been the crime movies  and this one is a decent addition to the lot  \\nforget the lame title and malcolm mcdowells narration of the obvious plot points  and concentrate on the films stronger attributes such as its style  the exquisite atmosphere of the time period  its original look at the gangster dynamic within the same group  its memorable sequences and the solid performances from its two main leads  bettany and thewlis  \\nincidentally  unlike a few of the gangster flicks that i mention below  this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of films    its the real deal  \\nnote  this film is packed with strong accents all around  which makes it hard to make out some of the words from time to time  \\nits also quite violent and i dont remember any film that used the cword as much as this one  so leave the kids at home for this one

problems  paradoxically  by not cronfronting them  \\nit doesnt simply plug in the  right thing  at the  right time   it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant  \\nbuilding a strong foundation is important to all forms of media  without which  what is there to build on  \\nwere given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters  especially our main character  scarlett ohara  leigh   a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel  a cunning wit  and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time  \\nshe knows how her society works  wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her  \\nright from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be  \\nbeing the most soughtafter woman allows her to manipulate men  and their women  to ensure she gets her way  whether it be obvious  i  e  \\nwho will be the one to get her food   or subtle  i  e  \\ngetting married just to spite someone   \\nthe man she claims to love is ashley wilkes  howard   a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him  \\nhe isnt so arrogant and demanding as scarlett  in fact  hes engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his  \\nher name is melanie  de havilland   and she is one of the sweetest  kindest  and most likable characters one will ever see  \\nshe and scarlett become very dear friends  but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her  and the love she has for her husband  \\nher meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic  it defines who she is  but doesnt give her much emotional selfdefense  \\nacting a catalyst to the love triangle  and to the story as a whole is the daper  stongwilled  cunning  cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler  gable   \\nhes quite a character all right  everyone listens to what he has to say even though hes got a bad reputation  \\nbutler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior  \\nhe tells everyone the muchneeded truth in the rigid castelike society where freewill doesnt seem to exist  everything is done out of honor and tradition  \\nfor example  in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners theres no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out  \\nthis angers them  not for his lack of faith  but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that  \\n  do we have ammunition factories  \\ndo we have food  \\ndo we have a navy  \\nall we have is tobacco   \\nall true statements and yet the south still insists hes wrong  \\nbutler is a shifty character to be sure  but he takes such pride in his arrogance its appealing  \\nscarlett notices this too when she first sees him  and from the look butler gives her  we know hes not going to stop until he has her  \\nbut scarlett cant get past her need for ashley  and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story  butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever  \\nand so the story goes on  with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life  \\nthe conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband  especially after she is  marked  for life when her first husband dies  \\nthis gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story  \\nsome are vital for only a few scenes  but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film  \\nin most films only a few characters exist for support in background  but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance  \\neven people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set  \\nthe costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place  \\nthe filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside  real world  but these types of simple approaches are never taken  \\nthe first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war  \\nfleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is  \\none scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming   no  \\nnot my leg  \\ndont cut off my leg   \\nanother scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street  but as the camera pulls back  we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers  but it is their moaning thats more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be  \\nas the second half begins  the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who singlehandedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north  \\nshe manages to resurrect the family plantation  but all the willpower she has cant help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the souths ultimate defeat  \\nthis brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love hate relationship  \\nmost of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship  or lack thereof  between rhett and scarlett  \\neach uses the other for personal gain  but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other  \\nscarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett cant help but want her more every time she tries to oneup him such as marrying another man and taking over his business  \\nthey say opposites attract  but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities  it borders on magnetic polarization  \\nthey need each other and know this  yet they never seem truly happy together  \\nperhaps they mistake love for passion  and the film leaves it up to us to make this call  \\nboth have things the other wants and vice versa  but when they compromise  is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other  \\nlove and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film  were left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why  \\ngable and leigh do have great chemistry  always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture  \\nall  \\nnone  \\neither way is possible and its a mystery that cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings  \\nits safe to say most of us wont live such overly dramatic lives as those in  gone with the wind   but its still a masterpiece for its ability to give us a sense that weve just experienced a lifes worth of joy and pain  \\n',\n",

       " 'robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible  godgiven gifts  but are able to act like ordinary people  \\nin  the natural      he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs  the baseball player who was destined to be  the best there ever was   but still acted like a humble farm boy  \\nin  butch cassidy and the sundance kid      he was the most dangerous shot in the west  yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly goodlooking charmer  \\neven in  indecent proposal      where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love  redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency  especially when reciting a tale of lost love  \\nin his latest film   the horse whisperer   based on the bestselling novel by nicholas evans  redford again plays such a character  \\nredford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie  i suppose the character of tom booker  a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses  was just too good to pass up  \\ndespite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses  a magazine article coins the phrase  horse whisperer  to describe his uncanny talent   booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life  \\nbookers talents are taxed into service by annie maclean  kristin scott thomas   a new york magazine editor whose daughter  grace  scarlett johansson   was recently in a horrible accident  \\nthe accident  which is filmed with gutwrenching horror  happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses  an eighteenwheeler kills graces friend  severely wounds and traumatizes graces horse  pilgrim  and causes grace to lose part of her right leg  \\nannie believes that if pilgrim can be healed  grace will be healed as well  which leads her to booker  \\nat first  she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse  but that doesnt work  \\ninstead  she packs up grace and pilgrim  leaves her husband  robert  sam neill  behind  and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother  frank  chris cooper   and his sisterinlaw  diane  dianne wiest   \\nin many ways  the film is like a journey  both literally and symbolically  \\nthe move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal  and its hard not to see annie and graces leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs  country  \\nin  the horse whisperer   country is clearly the victor  \\nthe city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness  and it is not until the characters arrive in the wideopen spaces of montana that graces anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate  annies controlling nature begins to relax  and pilgrim once again learns to trust people  \\nredford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed  a river runs through it  six years ago  \\nin many ways   the horse whisperer  comes from the same poetic vein as  river   and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less cameratime on the grass and mountains  \\nbut then  that would ruin the magic  \\nmuch of the films photography is truly elegant  and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land  \\nto further emphasize this  redford and cinematographer robert richardson   natural born killers    platoon   cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film  which takes place in new york  with mostly cold  harsh bluish filters and a more squarish      aspect ratio  when the action shifts to montana  richardson switches to softfocus and natural lighting  and the screen widens to a      aspect ratio  \\nin terms of the story itself   the horse whisperer  gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david leans  a brief encounter     and clint eastwoods  adaptation of robert james wallers  the bridges of madison county   richard lagravenese  coscreenwriter here also adapted  bridges    \\nalthough  the horse whisperer  has a strong romantic sensibility  i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story  \\nit seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband whos being left behind for this brief  heartsweeping affair  but there rarely is  \\nin  the horse whisperer   the thankless role of being the fuddyduddy husband falls to sam neill  \\nhe plays the character as a decent  hardworking man who is a good husband and father  his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him  \\nhe is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away  but simply because he happens to be a normal  fairly uninspiring man  \\nthere is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character  \\nit shows booker and robert going into a horse pen  booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all  while robert looks somewhat frumpy and outofplace in a baseball cap  \\nas they enter the pen  booker assuredly swings over the fence  while robert hesitates  then opens the gate and  in a goofy moment  forgets to close it behind him  \\nits a small scene  but it clearly demonstrates the movies thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness  \\nafter all  booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it  \\nthe best scenes in  the horse whisperer  tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie  but rather the healing process of grace and her horse  \\nalthough bookers horsetraining methods are mythical and unrealistic  the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing  \\nthese are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace  some of which are humorous  and all of which are tender and true  \\nat some point  i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more  \\nnevertheless  redford is obviously a romantic at heart  and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film  \\nthere are no dramatic sex scenes  but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slowdancing  always moving ever closer together  that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together  \\nalthough the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character  there are enough moments like that which make  the horse whisperer  worth the price of admission  \\n',\n",

its name to the films title  \\none day  american movie superstar anna scott  julia roberts  walks in to purchase a book on turkey  \\nquickly enamored of each other  the two embark upon an onagain  offagain love affair replete with romance  humor  and the occasional lump in the throat  \\nthe film opens with a nonverbal cue to annas stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actresss appearances in films and at premieres  coming out of limousines  walking the red carpets and such  \\nwithout words  this sequence gives us a background to her character  \\nfollowing  however  is a setup narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives  \\ni dont know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldnt have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film  and which never resurfaces after the movies beginning  but there it is  \\nif there were ever a clear case for  less is more   this would be it  \\nthe film is told nearly first person from williams point of view  as he is in every scene  \\nby nature of this arrangement  we get a very definite sense of what he is all about  and his nice guy personality wins us over easily  \\nin fact  much of notting hills strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis  \\na scene where william is still in shock over the fact that hes even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honeysoaked apricots from his refrigerator  \\nor take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image  \\nwilliam assures her he wouldnt say a word  then adds   well  ill probably tell myself now and then  but id never believe it   \\ngreat stuff  \\nthe downside to spending so much time with william is that we dont get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible  \\nwere constantly exposed to williams thoughts  feelings  actions and desires  but dont actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him  \\nthere are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest  but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that were not sure what shes been thinking all the times in between  \\nthis  combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two  makes this hugh grants film hands down  \\nhe gets the great scenes  look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna   the great lines  and gives an overall wonderful performance  \\njulia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actresss top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film  ala sandra bullock in a time to kill  along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her characters unpredictable behavior  \\nanna doesnt get a lot of our compassion  \\nthis romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance  much of it supplied by grant himself  but with considerable help from the supporting cast  \\nmost notable is rhys ifans as spike  williams eccentric roommate  who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh  \\nhugh bonneville  emma chambers  james dreyfus  and gina mckee bring up the guard as williams friends and family  particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sisters birthday dinner  and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst  \\nits a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation  \\nroger michells use of visuals doesnt sweep us off our feet  but does give us more than your typical movie of this type  \\nfor example  there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass  \\nwhereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying  eight months later   michell presents us with more interesting cues  such as williams walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him  \\nanother memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air  \\nwere generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so  but in this case  the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a birds eye view of the ground below  \\nmusic is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the films scenes  and some of this might have been better toned down  but in other areas it works to full effect  \\nits kind of a mixed bag  but still fares better than many of todays lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video  \\nat least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate  \\nnotting hills grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the alltime greatest film pairings  but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it  \\nfor a couple of hours  you should expect to laugh more than cry  and thats not so bad  now is it  \\n',\n",

\\nnow let me clarify  i dont love just any cop movie  im not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the s and now slowly  gulp  returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker  \\nim partial to those gritty  earthy cop dramas like serpico  donnie brasco  and the french connection  \\nproblem is these films come along just about as often as george w  bush makes a cogent point so whenever a  true  cop movie does hit multiplexes  i come running towards it like an eager puppy    and inevitably i leave  head bowed  tripping over my squiggly tail  \\nso what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out    for a movie called one tough cop  which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spinoff  no    \\ntruth is im a sucker for those barren streets  that gritty  graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops  like modern day knights  must shield us from their iniquitous clutches  \\nyes its all very corny and awfully boys clubish  which  im guessing  is precisely where these feelings come from  \\nas little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joes  enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies  etc  the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies  and heighten them  turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos  \\nas an adult my tastes havent changed all that drastically  sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film  but i still delight at the promise a  guy  film could potentially bring  \\nnow what if its the cops whore the corrupt ones  \\nooh that one really gets me going  these protectors using all that at their service  taking advantage of others for their own gain  \\nthrow a courtroom drama  yech   \\ninto the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city  \\nhow absorbing is prince of the city  you ask  \\nso damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama  a subgenre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar  i remained completely and utterly involved  \\nthe film stars treat williams  who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at  \\nsince i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city  i cannot provide an answer as to why it didnt  \\n  though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves   \\nlike mickey rourke and eric roberts  both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory  williams is a talented leading man who didnt make it to where he should have  \\n  if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell   \\nhere  the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacinos in serpico  also directed by lumet   \\nwilliams plays danny ciello  a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty prejuliani streets of new york  \\nthey work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes  \\nand that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done  \\nthe squad relies entirely on informants  low level junkies  to gain access to the big wigs  and in order to obtain the info they seek  they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice  \\ndanny has done this  and though hes a fairly honorable guy  who took the job in order to do good  his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way  \\nhe seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a  double agent   \\nhe does so with one condition  he will not rat on his partners  \\nright away we know that that is exactly what hell have to do  \\nand watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be  \\nundercover cop films are almost innately exciting  even the kind that pull out all the cliches  like in too deep   \\nhow can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal  ambiguity  and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position  \\nprince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive  hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet  as well as a handful of intense performances  most notably by treat  \\nlumets greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back  and lets the camera soak up the action  \\nhis scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension  and he rarely holds for reaction shots  instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking  \\nlumets worst tendency is one that many film makers  especially oliver stone  tend to overuse  he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension  \\nthis isnt as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan  lumets most recent cop  lawyer endeavor  a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching  \\nthough of late lumet has made several really awful career choices  maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something   the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria  here he was on  sustaining tension in a film that runs for  minutes with not one dull spot  \\nsome of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic  \\nhollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable  \\nof course cop movies arent popular anymore  yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines   but just look at the average hollywood action movies  flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isnt gay  the lame comic relief character whos never funny  and on and on  \\nfor all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop  courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills  \\nit focuses completely on its story  and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies  \\ntheres a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if hes about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches  but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing  \\nthis is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film  even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon  not one damn tear  it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human  excuse me  weak  \\nin the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness

frankenstein   \\nsince i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film  there is no way to know how accurate the film is  but i suspect that much of it only came from whales inner fantasies and hallucinations  \\nwhale  who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures  decided fifteen years before his death at age  to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him  \\nas the film tells it  during the end of his life  whale  at his large home in l  a   became infatuated with the tall  handsome  and much younger man  clayton boone  brendan fraser   who was working as the gardener at his home  \\njames whale  we learn quickly was  what many people refer to him as in the film   a dirty old man   \\nin one of the opening scenes  a young film enthusiast visits whales home to interview him and whale agrees  on one condition  for every question he answers  the young man must take off an article of clothing  \\nbecause of this episode  we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting  later making the excuse that his bright  white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off  \\nclayon agrees  and doesnt really think much of this  much to the warnings of his friends  becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past  \\ncertainly  the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall  since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man  even though boone is not gay  and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life  as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis  \\n  gods and monsters  is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast  due to his sexual preference  and never got the recognition he would have liked  since he longed to be referred to as a  motion picture director   rather than a  horror director   \\nand in one heartbreaking scene  he attends a party with boone being his guest  held by director george cuckor  and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore  \\nit is evident that whales first love in his life was making movies  and when his career ultimately fell apart  so did his passion in life  \\nas played brilliantly by ian mckellen  james whale comes off as a sad  but dignified man  and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others  just as long as he knew he was being true to himself  \\nhe never hid the fact that he was gay  however  even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession  and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person  \\nthrough the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone  boone  of course  only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to  while it means so much more to whale  who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life  \\nalthough boone is only in a deadend job as a gardener of peoples homes  whale views him as the ideal man  not only one that is goodlooking  even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings  but one that will actually listen to him  \\nsince whale lives with only his loyal  but disapproving maid  touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave   it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world  and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor  \\nalthough an extremely fine and mature picture  a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness  \\nit is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments  but it is a little thin  and the structuring of the  onagainoffagain  friendship at the films center is fairly predictable  \\nwe know early on where these two characters are headed  and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds  \\nin lesser hands  this setup might have felt too calculated  but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this  \\nalso  a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar  effectively played by lolita davidovich   but abruptly dropped and never brought up again  \\nif the film was not going to follow up on this side story  then it  perhaps  should have been taken out altogether  \\n  gods and monsters  is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture  impressively directed by bill condon  who  i sense  relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone  \\nthe film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end  \\nwalking away from  gods and monsters   it was ian mckellens marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me  and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably  \\nit is a sad testament when a persons true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them  based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life  which  ironically enough  is no one elses business in the first place  \\n',\n",

capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both  just wrack your brain and come up with a  gasp  new idea   \\nthis remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list  and was actually quite the opposite  \\ncontemporary liveactiondisney films are not one of my favorties  anyway  theyre usually unfunny  alienating  and a big fat bore  at least to anyone over the age of  and above the iq of   \\nthis one  however  is shockingly not bad  \\nin fact  its actually good  \\nnot the original good  but whats great about it is that it doesnt necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining  \\nbecause its cute and innocent fun  \\nbecause it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with  \\nbecause the lead star is immensely appealing  \\nbecause the parents are also immensely appealing  \\nand  im repeating myself  because its cute and innocent fun  \\ntheres nothing too risque about it  save the plot  the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish  but that is precisely the point of the movie   and its aimed directly at either kids  adults who want to remember the original  or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid  \\ni  personally  am somewhere between the second and third  \\ni can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasnt so weird or diverse  the names godard and kubrick werent even a glimmer in my right eye back then   when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abcs  wonderful world of disney   where theyd show you a liveaction andor madefortv disney flick an hour per week  \\ni can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films  like  lady and the tramp  and  pinnochio    \\nand  most sadly  i remember every single christmas  without fail  there were a barage of childrens animated halfhour shows  made exclusively for the christmas season  that i wouldnt dare missing  \\ni can even remember seeing the madefortv  parent trap ii  on tv one night  and after i had seen that one over and over and over again  i saw the original  parent trap   \\nits more of a late childhood movie  because it deals with the issue of divorce  but it deals with it in a disneyized version  \\nits playful  and witty  and charming  and if i saw it for the first time right now  having never experienced that part of my childhood  id probably dismiss it  \\nid probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadnt seen the original at such a perfect age  \\nwatching it  i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film  and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seeminglyperfect parents splitting up  and how it affected my adolescence  \\nand also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke  and pointed out that even in the most fuckedup of situations  things could always work out if you  well  manipulate things a bit  at least for the better  \\nthis new version did that for me  but its also charming in its own way  \\nit has a new cast  a contemporary feel  and  for the first time in awhile for a liveactiondisney flick  a tone that isnt corny or condescending  but just right  \\nthe moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way  \\nand for the first time since the original film  the kids actually know better than the foolish adults  \\nthe story is basically classic by now  repeated almost as many times as kurosawas  the seven samurai   a pair of twins  played here by lindsay lohan  just like they were played by hayley mills in the original  are separated at birth by their divorcing parents  \\none  annie  is sent to live with the mother  natasha richardson  resembling her mother  vanessa redgrave  more than i had ever noticed  in london  where she lives with her parents and her devoted  foppish butler  simon kunz   as she works as a swingin fashion designer  \\nshe grows up refined and classy  but also with a keen knowledge in sports and pokerplaying  \\nthe other  hallie  is sent to northern california with her father  dennis quaid  to live on a vineyard with their pseudomaid  lisa ann walter   and grows up rugged yet charming  \\nthey both meet at the same camp  one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged  \\nthey feud because they look alltoo similar  and are thus in tight competition  which results in some nasty pranks  which winds them in seclusion together in a private  outoftheway cabin  \\nthere  they become friends  then learn about eachother  \\nonce they know everything  they concoct a scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent  whom theyve only heard of  \\nthey learn about eachothers lives in detail  they make sure they look alike  which requires hair cutting and  notoriously  earpiercing  a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in  pulp fiction    and when the end of summer comes  they switch and hope for the best  \\nlindsay lohan doesnt necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original  \\nbut she comes off just as appealing as she did once  \\nshe does  though  add a couple new things  she makes the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original  respectively  \\nshe also adds on an american and british accent to each one  with one faking the other accent throughout  and if you really take notice  you can see that the fake ones accents arent exactly perfect  \\nshes also incredibly appealing  not merely cute  which is especially notable since this is her first feature film  and we know how notorious child actors are  especially in their first films  \\nshe makes a great protagonist  and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing  \\ndennis quaid  in fact  hasnt been this likable in about a decade  his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him a notable actor in the past  not just that hes mr  meg ryan  \\nditto natasha richardson  except that she just hasnt ever been this likable period   \\nthe two make a winning couple  maybe not so winning as maureen ohara and the late brian keith in the original  but they still work for this film  \\ninstead of the bickering that ensued in the original  the film adds another dimension and another angle to their characters that was amiss in the original  during the opening credits  we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe  where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother  and when back together again  the films more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental  but in that great way  not the migraineinducing way as in many such films  \\nthis all brings this new  parent trap  to a level of entertainment that hasnt really existed since  well  the original film years ago  still my money the best liveactiondisney flick of all time  \\nthis is because it has a form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot  a golddigging sharon stone type  played by elaine hendrix  whos deliciously tormented by the twins later on in the film  a treat instead of a bore  \\nlike the original  this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be  case in point   it takes two  starring the olsen twins  because it treats the children as the smart ones  and the adults as the silly ones  not the other way around  \\nand because  above everything  it knows exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew  \\nhowever  in comparison with the original  it could be a bit better  \\ncertain scenes work well  but not nearly as well as they worked in the original  \\ni liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than i liked watching two old flames getting back together over a bottle of wine  somehow  feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing  a lesson extracted from the howard hawkscary grant films of yesteryear  \\nand as much as this film transcends mere cutedom  compared to the original  this film almost drowns in cutedom  \\nthe original  though not gritty  was far more stylized and just as suitable for adult audiences as it was for young audiences  \\nas such  this remake may never be nearly as great or classic as the original film  but it at least knows how to treat its source material with dignity and respect  and how to create virtually the same effects without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyances  \\n',\n",

and is not only effective on a technical level  but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling workingclass family  \\nkevin bacon and  especially  kathryn erbe  s  dream with the fishes    are topnotch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems  \\nafter tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions  he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house  and instead of maggie not being understanding  she instead believes what tom says  and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through  does not try to stop his pursuit  \\nbacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts  and therefore  are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet  \\nin a masterfullydone  entrancing sequence  tom is hypnotized by lisa  but instead of watching him  we instead see what he sees  starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness  \\nlisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater  and so  we  as

letters pops up on the screen  we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is  sleep   \\nnever before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantlyconstrued as this one  \\ntruthfully  this setpiece  and another in which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt  are worth the full price of admission alone  just to see them on the big screen  \\nhaving loads of fun with her small role as maggies sister  lisa  illeana douglas  s  to die for   her last great character  is a delight  but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films  \\nfunny and enjoyably offbeat  douglas gets to utter the best line in the film  while talking to maggie about toms visions of the girl  she remarks   i wouldnt be worried about him seeing another girl  although the fact that shes dead gives one pause   \\nalso of note are jenny morrison  s  intersection    who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character  and liza weil  remarkable in s  whatever   as morrisons grieving teenage sister  debbie  \\nif the resolution of  stir of echoes  does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential  and it doesnt   what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty  \\nthe music score  by james newton howard  and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects  successfully compliment and foreshadow the offkilter frameofmind that tom is put into  and director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realisticallywritten characters  \\n  stir of echoes  isnt as good as  the sixth sense

to self  kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film   \\ni dont think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan  \\nwell  it does contain this element  but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements  and seemingly more interesting ones at that   \\nthe devils advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session  \\nkevin lomax  keanu reeves  is the defense attorney  working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl  \\nhe ends up with a notguilty verdict  despite an emotional testimony from the victim  heather matarazzo   \\nhe leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann  charlize theron  where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury  \\nhe accepts  mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive  and he flies to new york with his wife  \\nafter proving his worth for selecting juries  and his perfect winning streak in court   the head of the firm  john milton  al pacino   asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer  \\nhe graciously accepts  where he is treated almost as a god  \\nhe is given an incredible apartment  which is bigger than my entire house now   and a hefty paycheck  \\nhis life seems to be on the rise  \\nand of course  his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline  \\nhe is attracted to fellow employee christabella  connie nielson   and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment  \\nmary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice  especially if it is not wanted  \\nmeanwhile  kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen  craig t  nelson  who apparently murdered three people  \\nhe spends hours upon hours with this case  while forgetting his loving wife  who may or may not be going insane  \\nall of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself  \\nafter a while  things turn completely upsidedown  as kevins wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends  \\na fellow employee is murdered in the park  and his mother  judith ivey  reveals information about kevins real father  \\nis it all just a big nightmare  \\nor is john milton really satan  playing tricks with kevins life  \\nthe devils advocate plays out fairly straightforward  but for some odd reason  the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we dont expect  \\nis this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed  \\nif so  the devils advocate messes up completely  and ironically  i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now  than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early  \\ni went into the devils advocate expecting a shocking horror film  and that is exactly what i got  \\ni was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally  and that is what i got  \\nbut what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending  did i mention that i didnt like the ending    \\nthe producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending  they pull the rug out from under you  \\nfilms like seen and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected  more or less  \\nwe know it is going to end in an unpredictable way  \\nthe devils advocate  on the other hand  ends unpredictably  not from us knowing a lot  but knowing nothing at all  \\nif that is confusing  i recommend watching the film  and then reading that again  \\nas for the film overall  i enjoyed the entire first two hours  being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study  \\nthe film runs like a wellbuilt clock  slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax  and an unpredictable one at that   \\nand then you settle in for a nice resolution  which does not occur  \\nit was at this point that i felt cheated  \\ntaking us on a terror ride of intrigue  we follow kevin lomax around  as he is the centerpiece of the film  \\neverything occurs from his perspective  \\nhe is our representation on screen  sort of   \\nbut we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game  \\ni dont want to spoil the ending  so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself  \\nperhaps the most shocking thing about the devils advocate is the extreme amount of everything  \\nit earned its r rating for a reason  \\nthere is plenty of nudity  sex  violence  gore  and then you have gore  violence  sex  and more nudity  \\nthis film really isnt subtle about anything  showing us everything  \\nit actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc rating  as it is quite harsh  \\nhowever  the movie does have its merits  and nudity and sex are among those  \\ni dont condone sex and nudity in films  but if its there  i might as well enjoy it  \\nthe biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch  \\nthe confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining  but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife  mary ann  \\nportrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron  mary anns problems are incredibly intense  and i found myself wanting to witness her decline  \\nthis may sound uncaring  but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her  \\nshe is the most interesting character on the screen  who is forced into a world where she is not wanted  \\nsomething the devils advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity  especially for a film of this nature  \\nthe story actually has something to say about humanity  \\nin one of the last scenes  john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children  he is satan  of course   \\nhe comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity  \\nthen  god sets up rules which contradict human nature  \\nthis semireligious bashing is more humorous than frightening  \\nwhat milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud  partially thinking it was funny  but patially realizing it was true  \\nthese moral dilemmas are present throughout the devils advocate  giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing  but im sure they came straight from the novel it was based on   \\nwhen a film has something to say about our society  it deserves to be watched  \\nthe cast of the devils advocate is one of the highlights  as we see memorable faces  and they put spins on those memorable faces we dont expect  \\nheather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case  and she does a great job  \\nprobably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves  \\nhe has proven himself an uneven actor  successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic   but he tops himself with this performance  \\ni have never seen him more believable to date  \\nal pacino is of course the scene stealer  \\nhis devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson  the witches of eastwick  and max von sydow  needful things   \\nhe could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes  but he remains completely believable  if that is the correct term   \\njeffrey jones  mostly known as the principal in ferris buellers day off  also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon  \\njudith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevins past  \\nconnie nielson is very effective in her role  and she also appears naked several times  \\none familiar face with a twist was  coach  star  craig t  nelson  who gives a very good performance  \\nthe devils advocate is rated r for sexuality  nudity  violence  language  and some gore  \\nat  minutes  this film moves along fairly quickly  \\nfor the first two hours  i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters  \\nthe technical quality is also remarkable  with great special effects and a good musical score  \\ndirector taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture  only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes  \\ni guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film  and hackford gave me just that for a long time  \\nbut just before the end  he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream  \\npersonally  i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early  \\n',\n",

something that most action films should do  and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot  \\nin doing so  the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than  say  the peacemaker  \\nunfortunately  because of those overused moments  we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film  \\nbut leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head  \\none surprise  in particular  left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script  \\naction films are a dime a dozen in hollywood  and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us  they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre  intelligence  \\neven horror films have learned this  a genre which is probably the least respected of them all  \\nthe river wild was one of the best actionsuspense films i have seen from the s  \\nthe intelligence of the screenplay  and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day  \\nthe edge has the intelligence and smart characters  but this time the lack of originality is the downfall  \\ni must admit that it was very suspenseful  and had an original third half  but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes  \\nthis is an example of the final act saving the film  instead of the other way around  as in the lost world

cliches are given fresh twists  \\neven charles himself seems to have seen these action films before  \\nmy favorite line of the film comes from charles   most people die in the wilderness because they didnt do the one thing that could save their life    \\nthinking   \\ndespite the predictability of the main plot  a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise  and made me smile when i realized that everything isnt as it seems anymore  \\ni have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise  so instead i will avoid it entirely  \\nthe first twothirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along  and some of charles survival techniques seem possible  even making fire from ice  \\ntamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear  but whenever the bear is present  the characters lose all sensibility  \\ni have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water  \\nwhy not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across  \\ni guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while  \\nthankfully  we already have begun to care for the characters  and so we let this small detail slide  \\nbut some of the technical details are awkward  such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make  where did they get thread and needles    \\nthe acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature  and borders on phenomenal  \\nanthony hopkins gives a terrific performance  creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day  \\nhopkins usually brings greatness to his roles  but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences sympathy  something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs  \\nalec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen  it sure is better from his fair game   \\nbaldwin can be a good or a bad character  and here he succeeds at both in a way  \\nyou can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end  and baldwin is able to handle the doublenatured photographer  \\nelle macpherson gives a good performance  albeit slight  \\nshe isnt in the film all that much  but for the scenes she does have  she handles as an actress  not as a model  \\nharold perrineau is a good actor  and his scenes are nice and underplayed  \\nhe is eliminated early  and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable  \\nthe edge is rated r for graphic violence  some gore  and language  \\nsome of the violence is a little too disturbing  even for me  \\nthis film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to  but too many cliches bog it down  \\ndirector tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts  \\ndavid mamets script  though  has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat  and the acting is solid  \\nthe best thing about the script is the ending which doesnt end with the normal highstrung action sequence  but with a small detail involving a certain gift  \\nits a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear  \\nand by the way  most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear  \\nway to go  bart  \\n',\n",

that plan fell by the wayside for a while  because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released  \\npart of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in   grossing somewhere close to    in its original month of release   \\nsubsequent rereleases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved  and rightfully deserved   \\nto celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia  disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before  six stories high  \\nin an exclusive four month engagement  from january st to april th     fantasia  can be seen at many imax theaters across the us  \\nafter the engagement is over  the film will be shown at regular theaters  \\nis the format effective for the film  \\nwith a few exceptions  yes  \\nthe first segment we are presented with is set to beethovens fifth symphony  \\nits hard to describe exactly what this segment is about  but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily  \\neverything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil  black batlike triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts  \\neventually  shafts of light from above help drive away the evil batlike things and peace returns to the butterfly things  \\nthough this segment isnt very story driven  some of the images are very visually strong  especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things  who are all outlined in blood red colors  begin to overtake the skies  \\nthe next segment is set to ottorino respighis  the pines of rome   \\nin this segment  some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape  \\na whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack  \\nhe is finally saved  by another liberating shaft of light  and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the  oceans  of clouds  \\nagain  visuals are the key with this segment  especially where the whales are involved  \\nreportedly the whales  as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences  are shown as actual size  \\nthe cgi whales look incredibly lifelike  except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images  \\none especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent  \\nabsolutely beautiful stuff  \\nthe third segment  and the least of the eight segments  is set to george gershwins  rhapsody in blue   \\nthis segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld  and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york  \\ntheres a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer  an outofwork sad sack that dreams of having a

the ending has been altered from the andersen story   the steadfast tin soldier  is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short  \\nsome children may find the jester to be a little

torturing his fellow flamingos with a yoyo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number  \\nwhile it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia  it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy  \\nsegment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original  fantasia  and its the one that people remember most   the sorcerers apprentice   \\nthe story is the most recognizable  so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo  \\nunfortunately  the segment wasnt

that the other one didnt make it on the boat  \\nthey are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners  \\ndespite the

including everything that the sprite has worked to create  \\nsome amazing animation is present here  and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone  although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film   \\nthe host segments are largely  no pun intended  throwaways  although steve martins clip is pretty funny  \\nbe sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin  \\npenn and teller are usually funny  but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting  \\nthe best segment comes from  of all people  bette midler  who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board  \\npieces like flight of the bumblebee  a take on the four horsemen set to wagners  ride of the valkyries   and a strange segment prepared in the s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments  \\nfor fans of visual stimulation or classical music  fantasia  is a perfect way to spend the afternoon  \\nthe film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material  \\nas i mentioned earlier in the review  if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film  fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters  \\ni must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though  \\nthen you too can believe that whalestriangle thingssprites can fly  \\ng \\n',\n",
       " 'its tough to really say something nice about a type of person whos so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone  but by god   american history x  does it  and for that  i commend it  \\nit not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neonazi skinhead  a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone whos not what they are  and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off  \\nthe subject of this film is one of them  but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack  \\nhes the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage  and then in another brilliant stroke  justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks  \\nhes so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process  \\nhis name is derek vinyard  and hes played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks hes almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as  say  malcom x  when we first see him  hes clean shaven  with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast  a devlish goatee  and hes attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets  at least when he doesnt need them  \\nhe so believes in his convictions that hes willing to put his beliefs to the test  even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison  if only for a couple years  \\n  american history x  is about derek  how he became a neonazi skinhead  how he rose to power  how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself  and how he tried to save others  namely his younger brother  from making the same mistake  \\nwe see him at all of these stages  as a smart teenager  a vicious hate monger  a man having an epiphany  and the man who tries to correct what hes done before  and in all of these  we get a portrait of a man from all sides  \\nor at least  thats the intention  \\nthe films framing device is his brother  danny  edward furlong  perpetually looking about    also now a skinhead  and how his principal  bob sweeney  avery brooks  who i just found out was or is the captain on star treks deep space    is trying to  correct  him  \\nwhen the film opens  danny has just written a book report on  mein kampf   landing him in trouble with sweeney  which causes him to make him write a paper on dereks life and how it has gotten him nowhere  \\ncoincidentally  this day is the day derek is released from prison  and when we see him  hes cleanedup  not as buff  and has a full head of hair  \\nhes just as intelligent  but still very rough along the edges  but hes wisened up  \\nhes no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews  and tries to persuade danny  whos becoming what derek was before  to give up his lifestyle  \\nbut danny wont  \\nhe goes to a large skinhead beer bash  meets with the skinhead leader  stacy keach   and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neonazidom as he was for it a couple of years ago  \\nthe film circles around this  then spins off into nonlinear flashbacks  all done in black and white  \\nwe mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead  living in venice beach  organizing vicious and quasisadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white  middleclass teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work  and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on  \\nto them  the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop  and he not only speaks elloquently  forcefully  and intelligently  but he backs everything up with political reasons  justifying their rage at least to them  \\nand frighteningly enough  much of what he says sounds true  \\n  american history x  is a collection of really great scenes and moments  rather than a cohesive  great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next  \\nin it  there are some of the best scenes ive seen all year  \\none scene features a dinner between dereks family  and his mothers newest boyfriend  played with reserve by eliott gould   a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with dereks rightist views  launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience  goulds reaction to dereks final summation is unnerrving   \\nanother scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black coworker  guy torry  while folding laundry in prison  \\nand another soontobeclassic is actually divided in two  the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail  which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year  \\ntheres much more to appreciate  like the acting  which is uniformly good  with standouts coming from avery brooks  beverly dangelo  as the longsuffering mother   and gould  who has one horrible line  but other than that  comes off with the best performance hes given in what seems like a really long time   \\nnorton walks off with the film  though  coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble  \\nin only the fifth movie of his career  norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation  and maybe the best  \\ntheres nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie  spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience  coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando  \\nthat he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing  \\nsadly enough  this isnt going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be  \\nits too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece  \\nthe ending  especially  is pencilled in from other movies  tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon  \\nsome of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches  kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the  fat skinhead   whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more   and even the dramatic arc isnt as well travelled  \\nfurlongs danny never seems to really be learning a lesson  since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view  and when he decides to make a change by the end  which was inevitable   it doesnt seem like it has actually arrived there  \\neven dereks descent into skinheaddom doesnt seem justified  \\nthough his fireman father  william russ  the dad from  boy meets world   and dont ask me how i know that  is killed by a black junkie  and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently  there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs  \\nas such  one can see why the director  tony kaye  wanted to have his name removed  \\nsorta  \\n  american history x  is a very good movie  and i was very moved by it  but it could be a lot better  and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential  \\nsomewhere  he claims  there lies a tony kaye cut  and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton  who then ordered another cut  and that is thus  \\nalthough he aimed for the directing credit to go to  alan smithee   the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director  it wasnt allowed to him  under the grounds that once you disown a film  you can not badmouth it  but really  thats the macguffin  no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval   \\nkayes right in that its not up to par  even if hes not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par  \\nthis will not be a  do the right thing  for the late s  \\nyet it still gets its point across intelligently  and backs it up with its story  its message  that one cannot be so enwrapped in ones own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur  is literally said over the narration  unfortunately   \\nand even if it isnt perfect  at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten and

with little interference  \\nthere are none of the standard  hokey angel references used in recent films like  angels in the outfield     or  michael      \\nthe angels here are stark and believable  \\nthis early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition  for its shows how gods angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot  and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures  like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs  or the smell of the salt in the air  \\nthere is an inherent tragedy in being an angel  although there is much

not enough  \\nhe wants to be with her and share her pain  not just stand back at a distance  \\nhe learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to  fall  and

to go along with all this  but for seth  it will be worth it  \\n  city of angels  is something of a reinterpretation of wim wenders haunting  film  wings of desire   \\nwenders film was more like a poem  it was the feeling  the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened  \\nthe americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles  and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human  \\nand  unlike most foreign films that are remade into hollywood fare  it doesnt suffer extensive damage  \\nthis may be because director brad silberling   casper   and screenwriter dana stevens   blink   wanted to make  city of angels  its own movie  inspired by  wings of desire   but not an attempt to copy it  \\nand yet   city of angels  is not a typical hollywood movie  \\nit is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale   the english patient    whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world  \\nseale creates many striking visuals  in addition to the beach scene  there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around  looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by  \\nwhile the film travels along a charted plot  it takes time to develop its characters and situations  it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly  and shows just how thin those boundaries are  \\nboth cage and ryan give soulful  softspoken performances  \\nryan  who is usually so bouncy and energetic  truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch  \\ncage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple  heartfelt gazes  and speaks with the comforting  knowing voice that only an angel could have  \\nwhat is most striking about  city of angels  is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay  which is both unexpected and challenging  \\nits not a formulaic hollywood ending  because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time  \\nit doesnt give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance  \\ninstead  it offers something much better  something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive  \\n____________________________________________ visit  charlie dont surf   \\nan eclectic

blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers  but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture  \\narguably  more americans today can explain what  the force  or a  jedi  is than a budget deficit or a serb  \\nso  years after the release of the original  and  years since the third film  the return of the jedi  how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation  \\ncan a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy  luke  han solo  and darth vader all cultural icons  \\nagainst this challenge  the fourth star wars film  episode one  the phantom menace hit the screens last week  \\nand despite some early critical reviews in the major media  the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment  \\nwhile the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series  it is nonetheless engaging  exciting  and visually breathtaking  \\nit is a worthy sequel  er  prequel  to the original star wars films  \\nthe phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films  \\nas the film opens  obiwan kenobi  ewan mcgregor   the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars  is only a young jedi apprentice  still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor  quigon jinn  liam neeson   \\nthe republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation  \\nthe jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations  but in the middle of a planetary invasion  rushing to protect naboos young queen amidala  natalie portman   \\nlater  after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo  they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battledamaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice  \\non tatooine  quigon discovers a young slave boy  anakin skywalker  jake lloyd   who not only can help them get the parts they need  but displays uncanny intelligence  insight  and instincts  \\nquigon senses the child is  unusually strong  with the force and begins to suspect that he may be  the one  prophesized to  bring balance to the force   \\nas anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows  far from being a galactic savior  the innocentlooking yearold will in time become the ruthless darth vader  \\ncomplicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure  darth sidious  is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo  and sends out a lethal apprentice  darth maul  to find and capture queen amidala  \\nwhile amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet  they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul  \\nif the plot sounds a bit complicated  it is  \\nthe phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis  but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic  the demise of the jedi knights  anakins turn to evil  and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy  \\nbut the complexity is not overwhelming  \\nthe story moves quickly  with the only drawback being that many questions  predictably  remain unanswered at the end of the film  setting the stage for the next episode  \\none of the reasons the films story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing  but too unfocused  \\nits unclear whose story phantom menace is  \\nin the original trilogy  the movies were clearly lukes story  with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight  \\nbut its unclear whether this new film is anakins story or obiwans  \\nif this trilogy is centered on anakin  its a shaky foundation  \\nlloyd  like many child actors  lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers  and as a result  his character seems shallow and unimpressive  \\non screen  we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his littleboy face  or for that matter  any presence that would make him seem so special that quigon is willing to believe he is  the one   \\nthe rest of the cast does fine  though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas  \\nneeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight  \\nmcgregor is wellcast as obiwan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility  \\nportman fits the role of a young queen well  but her lines were often very formal  giving her little room to give her character much personality  \\nthe biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters  but the interaction between them  \\nindividually  the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars  and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series  \\nbut unlike the previous trilogy  lucas doesnt do as good of a job playing the characters off one another  \\nin star wars  there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han  han and obiwan  and leia and luke  \\nthe ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities  \\nin the sequence in where luke  han  and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star  the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other  \\nthere is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other  \\nindividually  they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests  but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them  \\nthis is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film  and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers  \\nbut despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction  the film is still very engaging  \\nmany of the wonderful elements of lucas previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining  \\nfirst  of course  is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates  \\nthe characters visit magical underwater cities  evade dinosaursized sea monsters  fight battle droids and menacing  destroyers  on venetianlooking planet of naboo  watch a spectacular event  part romanchariot race  part nascar circuit  on the arid desert planet of tatooine  then head to corsucant  the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council  \\neach location is elaborate and complex  \\nlucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings  he creates rich  spectacular landscapes  palaces  and skylines  \\nmost of the new special effects in his rereleased special edition trilogy in  were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just werent possible when the films were made  \\nmore than ever  in this new film  lucas universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures  robots with personalities  and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters  \\nthe best such character is watto  a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves  \\nwatto has a scratchy italian voice and a short  paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room  \\nof all the computergenerated characters in the film  watto is the best done and most enjoyable  \\nspeaking of computergenerated characters  no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film  jar jar binks  \\nwith more than  minutes of screen time  jar jar is the realization of george lucas dream to include a fully computergenerated character into the cast of the new trilogy  \\njar jar  a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race  literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jons accidental sidekick  \\njar jar usually performs a comicrelief role in the film  lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble  \\nthe animation of jar jar is nearly seamless  and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors  \\nhowever  despite the technological magic that makes his character possible  jar jar isnt completely convincing  \\nhe still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene  \\nthroughout the movie  jar jar never transcends a  roger rabbit  like presence  \\nyou accept that hes there  but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character  \\ninitially  i found jar jar annoying  but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film  \\non my second viewing of the film  jar jar was a lot of fun and i didnt mind him at all  \\na second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates  \\ndespite all the films struggles between good and evil  and the sober musings about ones destiny and  the force   like all star wars films  the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously  \\nfortunately  lucas hasnt lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment  not high art  \\nfrom the bumbling jar jar  to a oneman  twoheaded announcer team calling the action at the films thrilling podrace sequence  to a cameo appearance by e  t  \\nin the film  the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun  with lots of halfhidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed  \\nand finally  the phantom menace works because  as in all his films  there is no shortage of speed and action  \\nfrom beginning to end  there are lightsaber battles  hairraising chases  and thrilling duels between good and evil  \\nthe podrace sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film  and the final showdown between obiwan  quigon  and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed  most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed  \\nthe phantom menace wont win any major oscars  \\nit probably wont beat titanics box office record  \\nand its not even the best star wars film  id put it third  after the original and the empire strikes back   \\nbut its an exciting and entertaining film  far better than your typical summer blockbuster  \\nthe film cant live up to its hype  no film  not even the original star wars  could have done that  \\nbut its still worth seeing    \\nprobably more than once  \\n',\n",

who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city  \\nhowever  the focus of the film lies on his samenamed nephew  samuel l  jackson   who  as the film begins  is a cop whose takenocrap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors  \\nwhen a privileged young man named walter wade jr   christian bale  accused of a brutal  raciallymotivated murder is allowed to be released on bail  a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p  i  \\nbut thats easier said than done  for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez  jeffrey wright   a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri  toni collette   the only eyewitness to his crime  \\npeoplesor  rather  wright is also the big obstacle in jacksons way toward commanding this film  \\npeoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time  and wright is insanely funny during these stages  \\nhowever  he isnt so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish  and peoples eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable  which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo  who bowed out before filming   \\nits no easy task to steal a film from the jackson  who is his usual captivating  charismatic self here   but thats exactly what wright doesand makes it seem effortless  \\nthen again  with such a talented ensemble surrounding him  it is not too surprising that jacksons impressive star turn doesnt quite tower over the rest  he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other costars  \\nbale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_  so it only follows that his performance as a similar  less exaggerated character would be spoton  \\ncollette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened  conflicted diane  \\nbusta rhymes brings some good laughs as shafts sidekick rasaan  \\nregistering not as stronglybut through no fault of their ownare vanessa williams  as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez  and a dismayingly underused roundtree  they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price  singleton  and shane salerno  \\n  jackson also has little to  do  in a sense  some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside  his shaft doesnt even have one sex scene   \\nthat singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since hes not really an action director  \\nthis is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases  \\nthey move well  as does the film as a whole  and are reasonably exciting  its just that theres nothing terribly inventive about them  \\nthese set pieces are functional in the way the script is  they work well enough  but theyre unsurprising and conventional  \\nbut if theres anything that a _shaft_ movie does well  its make the familiar look cooland this _shaft_ keeps that tradition alive  \\nfrom the slick title sequencescored  of course  to isaac hayes everinfectious oscarwinning theme song  which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the filmon  the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado  \\neven a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced  it feels necessary  \\nstyle doesnt exactly make for a great film  but when it comes to _shaft_  thats of little consequence  \\nwhat matters above all else is having a good time  and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad muthashut your mouth  \\n',\n",

girlfriend  natasha henstridge   the fbi  and the russian mob in little odessa  \\nthats as much as you need to know  \\nthe story is adequate  but not overly involving  and the major plot points are basically explained to you twice  just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment  \\ntheres a love story  too  but i didnt find it terribly convincing  partly because exmodel henstridge is too highstrung in her highprofile debut  she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in species   \\nshes great to look at  and she can certainly read a line  but what she does here cant really be described as  acting   \\nof course   acting  isnt really what she was hired for  i lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van dammes   \\nthe movie is exceptionally violent  bordering on gratuity  \\n  keep that in mind when planning your date   \\nthe stunts are spectacular  and the fact that you can spot van dammes standin makes his work no less impressive  \\ntheres only so much you can do with a car wreck  but this movie makes crisp  effective use of pileups in a handful of frenzied destruction derbies  \\nand lam has a surprising  innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action  \\nthe main difference between lam and woo  i believe  is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show pieces  lam has figured out more about using cinematic space and doublebarreled points of view to make things run  \\ndont get me wrong  when chow yunfat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols and chewing on a toothpick with glass and confetti littering the air around him in woos hardboiled  its an amazing moment  \\nbut its a moment thats hard to reproduce in hollywood  \\n  for one thing  hollywood doesnt yet have chow yunfat   \\nwhile woos hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart  maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture  \\nthe very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a european city  but lams use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on  \\nthe film editing is a particularly savvy complement to lams shooting style  accentuating rather than amplifying the action  \\nthe performances could have used some fine tuning  in particular  theres an annoying  overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely   and the movie doesnt always overcome the limitations of its genre  \\nthe story is a little mundane  although there are some effective moments involving van dammes unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had  \\nbut its not often that hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying action picture  and its doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity  \\nvan damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the mans best movie  and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong konghollywood hybrid  \\n',\n",

mermaid  wannabes is getting to me  \\nyou know the spiel  a lame plot recycled from some wellknown story  colorful  almost psychedelic animation  the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson  the comedic sidekicksidekicks  the seemingly unattainable love interest  a few catchy songs  a few injokes for adults  and the occasional out of place warnerbrotherscoyotefalloffthecliff type joke  \\nits a formula  and like any formula  it gets tiresome  \\nthats why im delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights to the works of ghibli  a japanese cartoon studio  \\nfrom what ive seen of their movies   kikis delivery service  and the already englishdubbed and american distributed  my neighbor totoro    foreign audiences are in for a treat  \\nthese movies  particularly  kikis delivery service   are wonderfully original and entertaining  \\n  kikis delivery service  starts with an unusual premise  kiki  upon hearing forecasts of clear skies  decides it is time for her to leave home  \\nthis is unusual because kiki isnt a college student or a young adult making her start on the world  but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training as a witch  \\nher mother is also a witch  and as thirteen is the obligatory age for such training  her parents treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance  \\njust the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audiences  but no mention is made of the occult  and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie  kikis mother acts as a village doctor  and kiki is able to do no more than fly on a broom  \\nkiki must choose a city to move to  and what she chooses is the costar of the movie  a german seaport town  far removed from the country life she has been used to  \\ninitially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding  shes discouraged  and unable to support herself though her rudimentary skills as a witch  \\non the verge of leaving for a new town  she uses her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it  \\nthe favor eventually blossoms into her working as a courier  a onepersons delivery service  \\nthis is where the movie becomes shockingly good  \\nkikis job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her  \\nthe townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesnt seem forced or artificial  but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in a different light  \\ntheyre three dimensional  impossible to quickly evaluate  possessing of faults  and understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl  \\nhowever  each one has something about them  some interest or trait  that makes them interesting and unique  \\nthe personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings  the seaport town genuinely looks impressive  capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern needs of the s  \\nthis beauty is beauty with depth  for every detail left in  dozens are only hinted at  \\ni could probably go on all day  but i wont  suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie  \\nsome of my favorites are kikis relationship with the bakers husband  although hes quiet  never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie  and he initially scares her  his kindness wins her friendship  \\nin the garage of a deliverees house can be found a vintage model t  two old ladies have a relationship evolving from masterservant to friendfriend  \\nsuch details gives the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg  \\nadded on top of this is a lesson on the importance of selfworth  \\nkiki initially seems to derive much of her selfworth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her  but an encounter with a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment  making her question the importance of such beauty  \\nthis causes kiki to lose faith in herself  \\nhowever  kiki comes to realize not only the beauty of her surroundings  but the innate beauty inside her  \\nseeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous  and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i dont even want to hint at it  \\nthe ending of the movie has a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and  ironically  the most disneyesque moment ive ever seen  if you dont hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention  \\nthe movie steers free of many of the disney conventions  there is no violence  however cartoonish  no songanddance number  and kikis pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick  although jiji is given many funny lines and scenes  \\nhowever  i would be surprised if disney doesnt give jiji more jokes  or at least the voice of some comedian  \\nrefreshingly enough  the moral lesson of the movie is not selfcontradicted  a habit disney movies have gotten into  \\n  beauty and the beast  s beautiful belle  for instance  learned that beauty was derived from a persons inside  and was then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing  \\nkiki  on the other hand  learns to separate her wardrobe from her selfimage  and nothing more is made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film  \\nanother difference with disney movies is in the style of animation for  kikis delivery service   not as colorful and dynamic as disney animation can be  but with a greater attention to realism and detail  it fits the movie to a t  this is particularly true with scenes of kikis flights  \\nthe extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold  and helps these scenes capture the wonder of flight better than any other film ive ever seen  \\nim not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united states  \\ndisney tentatively plans a theater release of  monoko hime  shortly following the summer  japanese release  and should start releasing the other ghibli films after that  \\nid guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak seasons with no competing disney release  \\nalthough the wait is unfortunate  its good to know that its being released at all  for  kikis delivery service  is definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion and release  \\nwatch this movie  \\nalong with  man bites dog   and perhaps something by woody allen  this is the best movie ive ever seen  \\n',\n",

disappoint  \\nbrooks plays john henderson  a middleaged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce  \\nhe makes an attempt at dating  but fails miserably  \\nhe then has dinner with his brother jeff  rob morrow   a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life  \\njeff has a good job  a loving family  and most of all  a warm relationship with their mother beatrice  debbie reynolds   \\nafter dinner  john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice  and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunkydory the dialog is  \\nin comparison  beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him  and john gives it right back to her  \\nat the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart johns life  she says   i love you   and john replies with   i know you think you do   \\nthe thing is  beatrice is not overt with her criticisms  but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nitpicking and guilt loading  \\nits the kind that goes something like   yes  dear  i think you do that wonderfully  but      \\nit seems as though nothing he does makes her happy  \\ntheres always the big but  \\njohn believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women  either because of his flawed selfesteem caused by his need for validation  or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner  \\nhe comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home  he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out  and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is  \\n  a great experiment   he calls it  \\nbrooks own brand of humor really shines in this film  especially in the interaction john has with his mother  \\ntheres a scene where john has just arrived at his mothers house  and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito  and having explained to his mother about the  great experiment   beatrice asks   now explain to me again why you dont want to stay at a hotel   \\nshe still doesnt get it  and it is absolutely hilarious  \\nin the same scene  we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh  \\nshe apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over  \\nwhen john points out the ice on the sherbet  beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze  \\n  youve named the ice   \\nasks john  \\nhes also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator  such as a twentypound block of cheese  \\n  the freezer was a good invention   says john   but its not supposed to be used for everything  \\nthats why its smaller than the refrigerator   \\nits something most of us find strangely familiar  \\nbrooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur  \\nfor example  in defending your life  his and meryl streeps characters are in a comedy club having a discussion  \\nwhen theyre finished and walk out  brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line   and so the moral is  if you have to fart  go outside   \\nyou dont know what the joke was because you couldnt hear him during the entire scene  but i must have laughed for the next five minutes  it seemed so out of context  \\nin this film  brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene  \\ni dont want to give them away  but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past  \\njohns purpose for staying with his mother is to learn  and we as the audience learn right along with him  \\nhis mother is not the fascinating type to begin with  but as john spends more time with her  we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth  \\nwatching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way  \\non screen  brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character  you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world  \\nin a way  hes very much like yosarian of catch  expect with something of an attitude  \\ncasting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect  \\nshe assumes the part with ease  even moving and speaking a little slowly  and is just so adorable its hard to get mad at her character  \\nthis only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her  \\nas his first choice  brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice  but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband  who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimers disease  \\nthat may be just as well  since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely  \\nrob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mothers favorite and  for all his success in his job and family  is slowly exposed as a mamas boy  \\nthe only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes  \\na solid connection is not really made between johns troubles and his reasons for living with his mother  \\nadditionally  the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals  and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting  how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this   \\nbeatrice  you must think im some kind of moron  \\njohn  no  i think your someone who thinks im a moron  \\nbeatrice  well  it takes one to know one  \\n',\n",

was taking his cues from the monk  \\nbefore selecting an item  he would look at the monk  perhaps for some sort of confirmation  \\nsometimes he picked right the first time  and sometimes he made a second choice  \\neither way  whether through reincarnation or quick human perception  the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise  perceptive leader  \\nfrom this point on  the

social services  \\nbut the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage  \\nneither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable  wellrounded person  \\ncertain patterns take shape over the years  \\nfor example  the dalai lama is fascinated by technology  \\nradios  clocks  and telescopes are some of his favorite toys  \\nwhen he is old enough to accept his leadership  he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet  \\nhe also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain  including herd animals  \\nits nearly a

the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film  \\nbut the species series isnt about the lack of these elements  \\nits about how much it can get into one film  \\nand yet  behind it all  it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so  \\nspecies ii begins in the present day  though it seems to be an alternate universe  \\nmany films  especially scifi ones  create similar timelines as our realistic one  but change it to fit the films needs  \\nspecies ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft  the excursion  landing on the surface of mars  \\naboard is patrick ross  justin lazard   a very bright and very handsome astronaut  \\npatrick is the son of senator ross  james cromwell   who just wants patrick to succeed  \\nwell  it would seem that he has succeeded  \\nlanding on the surface of mars  he is the first human being to ever do so  \\nof course  he isnt the first ever  \\nabout a billion years ago  an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life  \\nnow  of course  the red planet is cold and rocky  \\nno life lives on it  \\nthat is  no visible life  \\npatrick  upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil  collects samples from the ground  \\nhe takes them aboard  and puts them in storage  \\nunfortunately  one of the samples contains a form of life  and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship  \\njust prior to heading back to earth  this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings  \\nthey pass out for approximately seven minutes  and then shrug it off as nothing  because they cant even remember  \\nthey blame it on a technical malfunction  \\nback on earth  patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible  \\nas we know from the original  this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet  \\nhowever  the children that are bred are halfhuman  as their father is  \\npatrick is really looking for another alien to breed with  and he finds it in eve  natasha henstridge   \\neve was cloned from dna taken from sil  the original alien  \\nhowever  this time around  most of her  alien  urges have been either decreased dramatically  or lie dormant  \\nthe project is led by dr  laura baker  marg helgenberger  reprising her role from

species ii is much stronger than its predecessor  but it is also much stronger than  say  aliens  hey  i love the film  but you cant tell me it was strong on story   \\nwhat surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay  \\nin my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college  we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles  \\nthis piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars  later  it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it   \\nthe script uses this effectively  but also manages to provide a wellbalanced plot  \\nbeginning with the first man on mars  something i have always dreamed of seeing   i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie  \\nand it does it quite well  \\nthe characters are all smart  and they know what to do and what not to do  \\nthe only character that seems a little cliched is the general  george dzundza   and yet  he remains logical in everything he does  \\nthere are the obvious flaws of course  mostly lying in the technical aspects  \\nthe special effects are only mediocre  and some are just plain bad  \\nbut for the most part  they remain believable  i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children   \\nalso  the most realistic ones are usually the goriest  ranging from people being torn open  or someones head being blown off  \\nhowever  some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience  including a menage a troi that is all but necessary  \\nmany people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex  nudity  and gory violence  \\nhowever  i tend to disagree  \\nwhat were the alien films about  \\nand  if an alien species ever did come to earth  and their sole purpose was to destroy us  wouldnt you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible  \\nmy only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store  \\ni didnt realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with  i just assume it is his parthuman side looking for the most beautiful one   \\nthe acting is quite good for this kind of film  \\nit is a vast improvement over the first film  at least  \\nthe acting is the key element to this film  if it was bad  it would have lowered itself into camp  if it was good  it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens  \\nokay  so it isnt that good  \\ngeorge dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting  as his overthetop impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting  \\nnatasha henstridge is limited this time around  as she is usually enclosed in a cage  \\nhowever  she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent  \\noh yeah  and shes quite fun to just plain watch  \\nmarg helgenberger is immensely better this time around  and her performance is probably the best in this film  \\nmichael madsen is soso  but he isnt annoying  and he soon becomes rather appealing  with his nice cynic personality   \\njames cromwell has a small part  but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor  \\nas i say  any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability  \\nmykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance  and he gives the film a more downtoearth feel  \\nand  of course  justin lazard  \\nlazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance  but i think he is effective  \\nsure  he is wooden  but isnt that what his character is like  \\nthe moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done  due to the couples acting  \\nspecies ii is rated r for strong sexuality  scifi violencegore and language  \\nthis is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see  \\nmore than likely  they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives  \\nhell  i dont even know if i will  \\nwhat is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year  \\ni probably wont see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while  \\ndirector peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful  and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series  \\nmedak has also mastered the wonderful  jump   \\nmoments  and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film  scream still has the first

civil war  \\nbroderick plays robert gould shaw  the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle  \\nshaw  the son of welltodo abolitionists  hailed from boston high society  \\nthe letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard  and were  evidently  the inspiration for glory  \\nas the film begins in   shaw is a captain in the northern forces  \\nlike private eriksson  michael j  fox  in casualties of war  shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the warthat is  until his company is attacked by enemy forces  \\nshaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle  witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck  \\nsoon after his recovery  shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war effort  \\nglory is the story not only of colonel shaw  but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery  \\nthe film periodically jumps between shaws point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers  \\nthe movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits  and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action  \\nthe large black cast is uniformly outstanding  especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth  \\nhe is brash and pushy  always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight  \\nhis bitter  tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability  \\nwashington provides much of the films intensity and emotional power  \\nin one heartbreaking scene  he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army  \\nwhen he removes his shirt to receive the punishment  you cringe at the sight of his back  which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as a slave  \\nit makes your blood boil  \\nthe humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings  a tear rolls down washingtons cheekand will probably run down your cheek as well  \\nthe episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasnt deserting the army at all  he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores  \\nfreeman is  as usual  a strong presence  even in a small supporting role  \\nhe plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember  \\nhe quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers  holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers  \\ncolonel shaw recognizes freemans leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major  making him the first black officer in the army  \\nandre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles  a free black who is one of shaws close childhood friends  \\nsearles is educated and refined  like a white man  prompting washington to nickname him  snow flake   \\nthe burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat  \\nthe road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment  \\nthe soldiers suffer innumerable hardships  but somehow they never lose their morale  \\nthe army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens  subjecting them to racism and discrimination  \\nthey are paid only  a month  whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen  and  for a long time  they have to go without shoes  guns  or uniforms  \\nto make matters worse  the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action  preferring instead to use them for manual labor  \\neventually  however  the regiment receives its boots  uniforms  rifles  and right to fight  thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw  \\nshaw has absolute faith in his soldiers  and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve  even if it means threatening a general with blackmail  \\nbroderick  in fact  is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment  \\nunfortunately  however  brodericks uneven performance is  in many respects  the weak link in the movie  \\nin an effort to look more mature  broderick sports a mustache and a goatee  and throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony boston accent  \\nhe is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced  \\nthe film places too much weight on brodericks character and not enough on the black soldiers  who are more intriguing  \\nglory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war  \\nthe movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july  \\nglory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts  \\nexcept for a few bullet wounds and one exploding head  the film  for the most part  leaves the gore to your imagination  which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid  \\nto the contrary  they are chaotic and horrifying  its just that director edward zwick  the cocreator of  thirtysomething   films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster  \\nthe key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers  \\nthe movie depicts some of  but not enough of  their customs and rituals  \\nin one scene  for example  the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire  \\neach man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration  \\na couple of the movies most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe  disbelief and pride  \\nthe regiments greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle  thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner  \\nlike any war film  glory has its share of gloom and despair  but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson  a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say  or  more precisely  what they do not say   blacks played a critically important role in the norths victory over the southforever changing the evolution of america  \\n',\n",

california  brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc  \\nif hollywood is the center of the film world  burbank is  or was  the center of tvs world  the world where our protagonist lives  \\ncombine all these names and concepts into  truman burbank   and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world  \\ntruman leads the perfect life  \\nhis town  his car  and his wife are picture perfect  \\nhis idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky  \\nthe radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart  \\n  \\n  \\nbut then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light  \\nthe next day during the drive to work  the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements  \\nhe is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian  \\nwhen the radio comes back to normal  the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully  \\nhis suspicion aroused  he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities  \\nthe world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator  \\nthe elevator doors open up on a small lounge with

is really suspicious now  \\nit gets even worse the next day when his wife  a nurse  describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge  \\n  its best not to think about it   she says  trying vainly to change trumans memory  \\ntruman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense  \\nat every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town  \\nhis last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world  \\nyou know by now that trumans life is the subject of a television program  \\nhis actions are  real  but everything else is carefully scripted  from the death of his father to the choice of his wife  \\ntruman is determined to find out what the big hoax is  \\nmeanwhile  christof  the allseeing creator of trumans world does his best to keep him unaware and happy  \\nits sort of like westworld told from the robots point of view  or jurassic park from the dinosaurs point of view  \\nwe root for the captive of the cageworld  \\nour protagonist is counting on  chaos theory  to help him escape his elaborate trap  \\nthe story  written by andrew niccol  writerdirector of gattaca   introduces some interesting questions  such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life  or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake  \\nalthough these questions came to mind  i dont think the film itself asked them  \\nit certainly didnt address them or try to answer them  \\ni was particularly disappointed that the film didnt deal more with the trauma of learning ones life is a tv show  \\ncarreys performance at the end showed a smidgen of trumans pain  but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the films pacing  \\nearlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well  \\nthe two seemed exclusive of one another  but weir and niccol didnt see it that way  \\nperhaps its not fair to criticize a movie for what it isnt  but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here  \\nbut on its own terms  the movie is well made  \\nsight  sound and pacing are all handled competently  \\nmuch of the first part of the movie is the truman show  \\nthe scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras  with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen  \\none hidden camera is apparently in his car radio  the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen  \\nthe music is wellchosen and scored  \\nthe film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music  when trumans world is still beautiful and perfect  \\nwhen the movie ends  the score sounds more like a frantic  driven  tangerine dream opus  while still keeping the same timbre  \\nphilip glass epic music  from powaqqatsi  permeates trumans scenes of suspicion and awakening  \\n  glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show   \\nand the pacing of the story was brisk  \\nthere was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show  just a few quick title cards  a few interviews  and then right into the show  and the movie  \\none of the first scenes is of the studio light falling  there was no token scene of trumans idyllic life before it falls apart  because it wasnt necessary  we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble  and no sooner  \\ntheres also no point in the movie where the plot slows down  \\nits a quick  straight shot to the movies end  \\nin terms of overall quality  i would compare the truman show to niccols gattaca  \\nboth films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds  \\nbut neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas  neither film  clicked  and became an instant classic  \\nnevertheless  i look forward to niccols next film  whatever it may be  \\n',\n",
